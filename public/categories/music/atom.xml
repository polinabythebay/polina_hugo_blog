<p>I am working on a small project to practice
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Change_ringing">change ringing</a> with
ClojureScript.</p>

<p>As always when starting a new project I have been consulting
approximately a million resources to get started. So I thought I&rsquo;d
collect them all together in one place instead of searching for them
over and over forever.</p>

<h3 id="getting-started-with-clojurescript">Getting started with ClojureScript</h3>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/maryrosecook/barecljs">Empty ClojureScript project, with instructions</a>,
from <a href="https://github.com/maryrosecook">Mary</a></li>
<li><a href="http://cljsfiddle.net/">CLJSFiddle</a>, for trying out ClojureScript
snippets</li>
<li><a href="http://gist.io/7610122">Explanation of cljs/js interop</a>, from
<a href="https://github.com/zachallaun">Zach</a></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="web-audio">Web Audio</h3>

<p>There&rsquo;s a newish API for synthesizing sound in the browser called the
WebAudio API.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://webaudiodemos.appspot.com/">Some demos</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/liamgriffiths/music-box">Very cool player piano app</a>
by Liam Griffiths, a Hacker Schooler in my batch. You will have to
run it on your computer but it will be worth it.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/mathias/hum">Hum</a>, a small ClojureScript wrapper
around the WebAudio API. If you want to test if it works in your
browser, try
<a href="http://cljsfiddle.net/fiddle/jvns.cljs-music-test">this CLJSFiddle</a>.
It should make an annoying noise when you run it..</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="sound-samples">Sound samples</h3>

<p>If you don&rsquo;t want to synthesize music, there are tons of samples on
<a href="http://www.freesound.org/">freesound.org</a></p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.freesound.org/docs/api/">Freesound API documentation</a></li>
<li><a href="www.freesound.org/api/apply/">Get a Freesound API key</a>. It says
&ldquo;Apply&rdquo;, but it gives it to you automatically.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/g-roma/freesound.js">freesound.js</a>, a JS library
for working with freesound</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/overtone/overtone/blob/master/src/overtone/samples/piano.clj">IDs for a set of piano samples</a>,
from the Overtone project.</li>
<li><a href="http://jsfiddle.net/jvns/J4sW2/">JSFiddle demoing the Freesound API</a>.
Scroll to the bottom to see the actual code; I copied all of <code>freesound.js</code>
into it. It should make a piano sound when you run it.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This week <a href="http://github.com/Apophenia">Lyndsey</a> and I worked on a
<a href="https://github.com/jvns/magical-orchestra"><em>★★★ Magical Orchestra ★★★</em></a>
in Clojure.</p>

<p>The idea behind a <em>★★★ Magical Orchestra ★★★</em> is that you go to
<code>http://my-ip:8080/client.html</code>, and then you get a page that looks like
this:</p>

<p><img src="/images/magical-orchestra.png"></p>

<p>Then a sound plays on my computer! Like a crow, or a cowbell.</p>

<p>So at presentations we plugged my computer into a speaker and let
everyone make noise. It was delightful.</p>

<p>If you are so inclined, you can have your very own magical orchestra
by cloning the repo above, installing Leinengen, and running <code>lein run</code>.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>TODAY WAS FUN.</p>

<p>In the morning I paired with <a href="http://webyrd.net/">Will Byrd</a> on some
logic programming. We worked on implementing binary search trees with
<code>core.logic</code> in Clojure. We got somewhere! My favorite thing about
logic programming is that all the functions end with &lsquo;o&rsquo;.</p>

<p>Here is what our code looked like:</p>

<pre><code>(ns core-logic-search-tree.core
  (:refer-clojure :exclude [==])
  (:require
   [clojure.core.logic.fd :as fd]
   [clojure.core.logic :refer [== fresh conde run]]))

(def my-tree
  [:value 6
   :left [:value 4
          :left [:value 3 :left nil :right nil]
          :right [:value 5 :left nil :right nil]]
   :right nil])

(defn containso [tree x]
   (fresh [v l r]
           (fd/in v (fd/interval 0 2000))
           (== tree [:value v :left l :right r])
           (conde
            [(fd/== v x)]
            [(fd/&gt; v x) (containso l x)]
            [(fd/&lt; v x) (containso r x)])))
</code></pre>

<p>Then we could run</p>

<pre><code>(run 1 [q] (containso my-tree 3))
</code></pre>

<p>and it would say that the tree contains 3. Which is okay! But the
really fun part is that you can run it &ldquo;backwards&rdquo; and ask</p>

<pre><code>(run 10 [q] (containso q 3))
</code></pre>

<p>and get 10 trees that contain 3:</p>

<pre><code>(
[:value 3 :left _0 :right _1]
[:value 4 :left [:value 3 :left _0 :right _1] :right _2]
[:value 0 :left _0 :right [:value 3 :left _1 :right _2]]
[:value 5 :left [:value 3 :left _0 :right _1] :right _2]
[:value 6 :left [:value 3 :left _0 :right _1] :right _2]
[:value 1 :left _0 :right [:value 3 :left _1 :right _2]]
[:value 7 :left [:value 3 :left _0 :right _1] :right _2]
[:value 8 :left [:value 3 :left _0 :right _1] :right _2]
[:value 2 :left _0 :right [:value 3 :left _1 :right _2]]
[:value 9 :left [:value 3 :left _0 :right _1] :right _2])
</code></pre>

<p>If you inspect carefully, you will see that those are all binary trees
and they all contain 3! =)</p>

<p>I am also doing magical music magic with Lyndsey, but that will have
to wait until tomorrow</p>

    <link href="https://jvns.ca/blog/2013/11/19/day-30-making-music-in-clojure-with-overtone/"/>
    <updated>2013-11-19T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>https://jvns.ca/blog/2013/11/19/day-30-making-music-in-clojure-with-overtone/</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today I started using a lovely Clojure library called
<a href="http://overtone.github.io/">Overtone</a>, for generating music. It is
pretty easy to use and a fun time. On the box it says that you need to
be &ldquo;comfortable with&rdquo; Clojure, the basics of music theory, and the
Supercollider audio synthesis environment. I do not know any of these
things and I successfully made sounds by copying and changing
examples.</p>

<p>I wrote a tiny bit of code to play rhythms. And I ran into my first
clojure bug! I defined a function <code>side-effecty-thing</code>, and ran</p>

<pre><code>(map side-effecty thing sequence)
</code></pre>

<p>And that ran fine. It made sounds!</p>

<p>But then I tried something like</p>

<pre><code>(def new-function [time]
    (map side-effecty thing sequence)
    (apply-at (+ time 4) '#new-function (+ time 4)))
</code></pre>

<p>which basically does the <code>(map side-effecty-thing)</code> and then calls
itself recursively, later. And this did not make sounds. And I was
TOTALLY CONFUSED, because, it says <code>(map side-effecty-thing)</code> in it!
It should make sounds!</p>

<p>But then Travis explained that <code>map</code> is lazy and not actually
appropriate if you want the function you are running to <em>happen</em> right
away.</p>

<p>So what I actually wanted to use was <code>doseq</code>, which will let you
actually make the side-effecty things happen when you ask for them.
And it throws away the result, which is good because I didn&rsquo;t actually
want the result. Yay!</p>

<p>ALSO EMACS IS ENJOYABLE. Paredit is nice. I am in fact not using Evil
mode. I am using Normal Emacs, with a few packages:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/rdallasgray/graphene">Graphene</a>, to make
everything a bit prettier</li>
<li>clojure mode, clojure test mode, and cider, for Clojure fun.
Apparently cider is the thing that people use now and it is the same
as nRepl.</li>
</ul>

<p>This is a strange and confusing world, humans! I no longer know how to
write if statements without looking it up! Very Exciting Times!</p>
