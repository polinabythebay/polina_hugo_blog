<p>I went to <a href="https://adacamp.org/">AdaCamp</a> these last couple of days. I
want to talk about some of the awesome stuff that happened!</p>

<p>AdaCamp is an unconference, which means that people decide what the
sessions will be about on the first day of the conference. Here are some
things I&rsquo;m thinking about!</p>

<h3 id="testing">Testing</h3>

<p>I went to a really, really interesting session about software testing by
someone who works as a software tester. I work as a developer, and I&rsquo;ve
never worked with a QA team! I didn&rsquo;t know there were people who
specialized in testing software and were really awesome at it who don&rsquo;t
write programs! This was super cool to learn. I still don&rsquo;t know how to
think about separating out the responsibilities of writing the software
and verifying the software &ndash; obviously individual developers also need
to be responsible for writing correct software, and it still feels
strange to me to hand any of that off.</p>

<p>But <a href="https://twitter.com/skamille">Camille Fournier</a> told me on twitter
about user acceptance testing and how you can have a QA team that checks
that the software <em>makes sense to users</em> and, like, talks to them and
stuff, not just software that&rsquo;s theoretically correct. So that&rsquo;s pretty
cool.</p>

<h3 id="awesome-people">Awesome people</h3>

<p>I met a lot of really interesting people! I met sysadmins and people who
had been programming for a long time and software testing and people who
know a lot about science fiction and ham radio and bikes and publishing
and zines and Quebec and libraries and Wikipedia (someone wrote their
<em>dissertation</em> on Wikipedia. Wow.). I learned SO MUCH about Wikipedia.
And almost all of those people identified as women! A++ would meet
delightful people again.</p>

<h3 id="codes-of-conduct">Codes of conduct</h3>

<p>This session convinced me open spaces are a good idea.</p>

<p>Initially I didn&rsquo;t want to go because I was interested in some very
specific aspects of codes of conduct (deescalating situations + how to
make CoCs less intimidating to people who are genuinely good intentioned
but not familiar with a given community + when to model behavior
implicitly vs writing down explicit rules). And I told someone during a
break that I didn&rsquo;t want to go to the session because I thought people
wouldn&rsquo;t be discussing the thing I wanted to talk about.</p>

<p>And she said AWESOME. THOSE ARE AWESOME THINGS TO TALK ABOUT. COME WITH
ME AND WE WILL TALK ABOUT THAT. And we did! And I don&rsquo;t have answers
about any of those things, but I got to hear some new perspectives and
stories and now I know a couple more things. And the other people seemed
to think the questions I had were interesting &lt;3.</p>

<p>And it made me remember &ndash; when I think that I&rsquo;m the only person who has
a given concern or question or experience, I&rsquo;m usually wrong :)</p>

<h3 id="moderation">Moderation</h3>

<p>There were a lot of unstructured discussion sessions at AdaCamp. This
was really cool, because it means you can cover a lot of ground. I also
was reminded again of how important good moderation + facilitation is,
and how much I want to get better at it. I&rsquo;m working on learning how to:</p>

<ul>
<li>create some explicit structure around a session (&ldquo;let&rsquo;s discuss these
4 topics, and spend ~15 minutes on each one. does that sound good?&ldquo;)</li>
<li>tell someone when they&rsquo;ve said enough &lt;3 (&ldquo;thanks so much! I&rsquo;d love to
hear from some people who haven&rsquo;t said as much yet&rdquo;)</li>
<li>move the discussion back on track if it&rsquo;s veered away (&ldquo;okay awesome!
Does anyone have anything else to say about $topic, or should we move
on to $next_thing?&ldquo;)</li>
</ul>

<p>People take up really incredibly different amounts of space in
discussions, and I really really want to get better at making sure
people who are quieter get a chance to say their super interesting
things. Interrupting people is hard for me!</p>

<p>After AdaCamp I felt like there are a lot of great people in the world
who are trying their best to do what&rsquo;s right and have a lot of good
ideas about how to do that and want to have the same conversations that
I want to have. A little more than usual =)</p>
