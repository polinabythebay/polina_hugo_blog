<p>I went to Data Day Texas this past weekend. It was a 1-day conference,
and I learned a lot!</p>

<p>Here are some things I learned! (any misunderstandings are mine, of
course :))</p>

<h3 id="charity-majors-upgrade-your-database-without-losing-your-data-your-performance-or-your-mind">Charity Majors: Upgrade your database &ndash; without losing your data, your performance, or your mind</h3>

<p>This was by far my favorite talk (<a href="https://speakerdeck.com/charity/upgrading-databases-without-losing-your-data-your-perf-or-your-mind">slides are here</a>).
Charity works at <a href="https://parse.com/">Parse</a>, where they manage many
thousands of MongoDB collections (as far as I understand it, at least
one for each of their users). And sometimes they want to upgrade Mongo!</p>

<p>I understood before seeing this talk that doing database upgrades was
hard, and that it&rsquo;s appropriate to be incredibly skeptical, but I didn&rsquo;t
have any clue how to plan to reduce your uncertainty so that you can
actually do the upgrade.</p>

<p>Some things I learned:</p>

<ol>
<li>How bad can it be if you don&rsquo;t test the upgrade properly? (she saw
one kind of query get 100x slower in the worst case, which would be a
disaster). The examples of what can go in an upgrade that she gave
were incredibly interesting.</li>
<li>How much time is it appropriate to spend planning and testing a
database upgrade? (they spend about a year)</li>
<li>How do you know if the new database can handle your production
workload? (snapshot it, take a day&rsquo;s worth of operations and test it
out on a production workload!)</li>
<li>When you actually do the upgrade, how do you do it? (slowly, with
lots of opportunities to roll back along the way)</li>
<li>Does Mongo have merit? (They need to support a ton of very different
workloads for their users, and it&rsquo;s a great fit for that.)</li>
</ol>

<p>There&rsquo;s also a &ldquo;A Very Short List Of Terrible Things Database Upgrades
Have Done To Me&rdquo; slide which is the best.</p>

<p>It gave me a little more appreciation for what it means to do ops at
scale and to keep services running. I pretty rarely see talks that I
feel really advance my understanding of a topic, and this was one of
them.</p>

<p>(also, I think I have a thing or two to learn from her about writing
talk titles)</p>

<h3 id="robert-munro-using-humans-to-make-your-machine-learning-algorithms-dramatically-better">Robert Munro &ndash; using humans to make your machine learning algorithms dramatically better</h3>

<p>Let&rsquo;s say that you&rsquo;re writing a classifier that&rsquo;s doing sentiment
analysis. This is a task that&rsquo;s pretty easy for humans (&ldquo;is &lsquo;had an
amazing time with my friends watching terrible cult movies today&rsquo;
positive?), but hard to do with machine learning, especially if you have
limited training data to use.</p>

<p>He talked about how judiciously incorporating human input to get a
better training set can give you much, much higher accuracy than just
messing with your model parameters.</p>

<p>My absolute favorite thing about this talk was when he talked about the
human/psychological aspects of using people to help you with
classifications! If you&rsquo;re writing a cat classifier and every single
thing you show the human is not a cat, they&rsquo;ll get bored and exhausted.</p>

<p>It made me think a lot about making sure if you&rsquo;re asking people to help
you with a task, you need to</p>

<ol>
<li>make the task interesting</li>
<li>make sure the people helping you out have a lot of impact on your
classification accuracy</li>
<li>make sure that they <em>know</em> how high their impact is, and show them
how the model is improving!</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="ted-dunning-generating-fake-datasets">Ted Dunning &ndash; generating fake datasets</h3>

<p>This was a fun talk about simulating datasets to</p>

<ul>
<li>prove that you&rsquo;re right about the Monty Hall problem</li>
<li>debug a database bug when your client can&rsquo;t give you the data that caused it</li>
<li>do machine learning on data you don&rsquo;t have</li>
</ul>

<p>of these, the first two made the most sense to me &ndash; I had a much harder time
imagining how it would be useful to do machine learning based on a simulated
data set in real life, and I think I missed some of the explanation.</p>

<p>And he told us about a tool called log-synth that he wrote to generate fake
datasets easily! I can pretty easily imagine myself using it to write ML
tutorials :). It&rsquo;s at
