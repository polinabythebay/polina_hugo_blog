<p>I work remote. This means that in most of the meetings I&rsquo;m in, I&rsquo;m a remote participant. If you&rsquo;re in an organization that has a lot of remotes, maybe this will be useful to you! There are two scenarios I want to talk about:</p>

<ol>
<li>Every person in the meeting is in a different location (100% remote)</li>
<li>There are 6 people in the meeting (5 local, 1 remote)</li>
</ol>

<p>Scenario #1 is great! Everyone has the same connection problems.</p>

<p>Scenario #2 is a disaster. It took me a long time to understand why, but I think the primary reason is that it&rsquo;s very hard to interrupt and indicate that I want to speak when I&rsquo;m remote. You can&rsquo;t indicate it visually as easily, so if I just wait for a break in the conversation to say something&hellip; well, it will never happen :)</p>

<p>Also, sometimes people can&rsquo;t hear me, and I&rsquo;ve had this exchange a lot</p>

<ul>
<li>other people: stuff</li>
<li>me: minor remark</li>
<li>other people: what? we didn&rsquo;t catch that</li>
<li>me: never mind.</li>
</ul>

<p>I&rsquo;ve gotten way better at being remote in meetings and interrupting. Now if I have something to say I just say &ldquo;HI I HAVE A THING TO SAY&rdquo;. And people say &ldquo;yes julia?&rdquo; and then I say the thing. It feels awkward but it works for me. But it took me a really long time to learn how to interrupt! Recently I was in a meeting with 8 local people and me and I said more than 5 things! I am now a remote meetings wizard.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s also hard to tell when a remote person is <em>done</em> speaking. I sometimes explicitly say &ldquo;that&rsquo;s all I have&rdquo; or something at the end. So my interactions are awkwardly delimited by HI I HAVE A THING TO SAY &ndash; I AM SAYING THE THING - I AM DONE SPEAKING NOW YOU MAY PROCEED. This is great and it works.</p>

<h3 id="local-people-can-help">local people can help</h3>

<p>I once ran a meeting with 6 remotes and 6 local people, where I was local. Normally, this means that the local people do all the talking and the remotes are totally silent (because the barrier to entry is high). To combat this a little, I frequently asked the remotes if they had anything to say (Dan, I know you care a lot about this. What do you think?), and they frequently did have something really interesting to say! They were just not saying it.</p>
