     <p>I had a performance review last week where I was told, among other things, that I&rsquo;m very good at debugging, especially difficult &amp; confusing problems. I thought about this and I was like YEAH I AM. But I didn&rsquo;t used to be. What happened?!</p>

<p>I sometimes hear advice to be extremely systematic and organized. I think that&rsquo;s good advice and I told my partner this and he laughed because I am not the most systematic and organized person. But here are some things that I think have helped me anyway:</p>

<p><strong>Remember that the bug is happening for a logical reason</strong></p>

<p>Sometimes when I hit a bug, especially a nondeterministic and difficult to reproduce bug, it&rsquo;s tempting to think &ldquo;oh you know, things just happen, who knows&rdquo;. But everything on a computer does in fact happen for a logical reason (however much the computer may try to convince you otherwise). Reminding myself of that helps me fix bugs. Also known as &ldquo;OK JULIA IT IS NOT FAIRIES WHAT ACTUAL REASON COULD BE CAUSING THIS?&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Be unreasonably confident in my ability to fix the bug</strong></p>

<p>I recently dealt with a performance problem in a job at work that took me 3 weeks to fix (see <a href="http://jvns.ca/blog/2015/09/10/a-millisecond-isnt-fast-and-how-we-fixed-it/">a millisecond isn&rsquo;t fast</a>). If I hadn&rsquo;t been able to fix it, I would have felt pretty bad and like it was a waste of 3 weeks.</p>

<p>But we were processing a relatively small number of records, and it was taking 15 hours to do it, and it was NOT REASONABLE and I knew that the job was too slow. And I figured it out, and now it&rsquo;s faster and everyone is happy.</p>

<p>(since I can now often actually fix bugs I tackle, perhaps this confidence is now reasonable :D)</p>

<p><strong>Know more things</strong></p>

<p>This <a href="http://jvns.ca/blog/2015/11/21/why-you-should-understand-a-little-about-tcp/">TCP bug</a> I talked about yesterday? I wouldn&rsquo;t have been able to fix that in my first job out of grad school. I just didn&rsquo;t understand enough about how computer networks work, or computers (I had an awesome math &amp; theoretical CS degree and I did not learn anything about computers there.). And I didn&rsquo;t know strace.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a service at work that sometimes takes a long time to respond because of JVM garbage collection pauses. If you don&rsquo;t know that a common source of latency issues on the JVM is garbage collection pauses (or worse, if you don&rsquo;t know that garbage collection pauses are even a thing that happen), then you&rsquo;re going to have a really bad day trying to figure that out.</p>

<p>Understanding the structure of the system I&rsquo;m trying to debug and what some of the common failure modes are has been really indispensable to me.</p>

<p><strong>Talk to other people</strong></p>

<p>I sometimes just ramble into the Slack channel at work about the problem I&rsquo;m working on, which sometimes looks like</p>

<pre><code>julia: i have no idea why this bug is happening
julia: i mean I tried X and it is still happening
julia: and also W
julia: and also Z
julia: OH RIGHT I FORGOT ABOUT ABC
julia: yayy
someone else: :)
</code></pre>

<p>Also sometimes if I start talking about it then someone will come and talk to me and say something helpful! It&rsquo;s the best.</p>

<p>I got really stuck on that 3 week bug we talked about before and got on the phone to <a href="https://twitter.com/avibryant">Avi</a>, which was VERY USEFUL because he wrote the code that I was optimizing. So in that case I didn&rsquo;t just need a rubber duck, I needed to talk to someone who knew more about the code (&ldquo;oh yeah we haven&rsquo;t optimized that part at all yet so it&rsquo;s not a surprise that it&rsquo;s slow!&rdquo;).</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve gotten way better at figuring out what I don&rsquo;t understand, articulating it, and asking about it.</p>

<p><strong>Use strace</strong></p>

<p>Seriously I could not fix bugs without strace.</p>

<p>More generally, being able to observe directly what a program is actually doing is incredibly valuable. I was trying to debug recently why a request I was sending to Redis was invalid. And I read the code, and asked other people, and they were like &ldquo;huh that looks right&rdquo;. AND THEN I REMEMBERED ABOUT TCPDUMP. (tcpdump shows you the TCP traffic coming in and out of a machine. it&rsquo;s the best.)</p>

<p>So I ran tcpdump on a machine that I knew was sending (valid) requests to Redis, just looked at it as ASCII in my terminal, and then all the information was right there! And I copied the valid thing into what I was testing, and it totally worked and explained everything.</p>

<p><strong>I like it more</strong></p>

<p>I used to not really like debugging. But I started being able to solve harder bugs, and now when I find a thorny debugging problem it&rsquo;s way more exciting to me than writing new code. Most of the code I write is really straightforward. A difficult bug is way more likely to teach me something I didn&rsquo;t know before about how computers can break.</p>

<p>❤ debugging ❤</p>
