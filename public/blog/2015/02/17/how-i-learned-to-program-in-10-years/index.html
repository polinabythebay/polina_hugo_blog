     <p>The other day someone emailed me asking advice to learn how to program.
He said he was planning to use &ldquo;Learn Python the Hard Way&rdquo;, which I
understand is an excellent tutorial. I don&rsquo;t generally like giving
advice, because I think it&rsquo;s way too easy to generalize your own
experience into advice and do it wrong.</p>

<p>But then I found I had something to say! I thought a little bit about
this blog, and how it might look like I sprang from the womb being
excited about strace or thinking about how to build an operating system,
or whatever. But in fact I spent about 10 years learning to program
before going to Hacker School, mostly at fairly low speeds.</p>

<p>I drew a totally unscientific graph about what that felt like:</p>

<p><a href="/images/unscientific-programming-graph.png"> <img src="/images/unscientific-programming-graph.png"> </a></p>

<p></p>

<p>You should not try to conclude very much from this graph, but some
events include:</p>

<ul>
<li>I started learning to program in 2004, because my math teacher gave me
a TI-83 calculator and then I wrote BASIC programs in math class.</li>
<li>A guy I added on MSN for some reasons I don&rsquo;t totally remember told me
to install Gentoo and use this new browser Firebird and I never tried
Gentoo but I did install a few Linux distributions!</li>
<li>now I&rsquo;ve been using Linux continuously for 11 years so that was a
pretty great decision I guess.</li>
<li>My dad bought me Learning Perl and I was amazed to find out you could
write subroutines and define your own variable names because on the
TI-83 you only have about 26 variables (A-Z) and there are for loops
but no named functions</li>
<li>I went to university in 2006 and somehow was given the root password
to a lab with 4 Linux and 3 Windows computers and wrote some terrible
perl scripts to do some user management and uh yeah</li>
<li>I finish university, with degrees in math/computer science. At this
point (2011) I still basically don&rsquo;t believe I&rsquo;m any good at
programming. I do not in any way consider applying to fancy jobs at
Google or Microsoft or whatever.</li>
<li>I get a <a href="http://evolvingweb.ca/">first job</a> and a <a href="http://www.viascience.com/">second job</a> and coding 40 hours a week teaches me
a lot about the software engineering side of programming</li>
</ul>

<p>So, I went back the other day to some of the older code I&rsquo;d written,
thinking it would be terrible. Here, I put it on Github:
<a href="https://github.com/jvns/julias-first-programs/blob/master/2005/grepstuff.pl">julias-first-programs</a>.</p>

<p>Notably missing is the perl script that I wrote in 2005 to convert the
digits of pi to midi music to write to a cd to give as a gift (?!). I
couldn&rsquo;t find it.</p>

<p>And, sure, it&rsquo;s not great code, but that&rsquo;s not what was the most
surprising to me. What was the most surprising was <em>how little of it</em> I
found. It turns out that in the first years I was learning to program, I
was also in school full-time, not studying computer science, and I
didn&rsquo;t necessarily write a lot of programs!</p>

<p>Most of what I found was little scripts like
<a href="https://github.com/jvns/julias-first-programs/blob/master/2005/grepstuff.pl">grepstuff.pl</a>.
And, sure, it&rsquo;s not well-indented or anything. But the scope for most of
these was so small (I was the only person writing or running most of
them!) that it didn&rsquo;t really matter if they weren&rsquo;t well-engineered.</p>

<p>Anyway, this is mostly to say &ndash; if you&rsquo;re programming and just starting
out, and worrying that people say you can learn to program in 24 hours
or 12 weeks&hellip; whatever. It&rsquo;s taken me 11 years so far, and I&rsquo;m not done
:)</p>

<p>If you know how to program, and wrote your own version of this blog
post, I would be interested to read it!</p>
