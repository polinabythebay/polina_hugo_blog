     <p>Coming down from <a href="http://bangbangcon">!!Con</a>, there are a lot of
things I want to talk about. One of the things that surprised and
delighted me the most was how well anonymous talk review worked. I
would like to tell you about this and how we structured our talk
review generally.</p>

<p>We decided to review all the talks anonymously, to try to reduce our
bias. This was a <em>ton</em> of work.
<a href="http://www.nullspace.io/">Alex Clemmer</a> personally anonymized all the
talk proposals and then sat out of the review process because he knew
the identities of the proposers. He did an amazing job (including
watching attached videos and summarizing them for the reviewers!).</p>

<p>I was honestly a bit scared by this &ndash; how were we going to make sure
people were good at public speaking if we didn&rsquo;t even know who they
<em>were</em>?! But it turned out my fears were totally unfounded. We ended
up with</p>

<ul>
<li>a diverse range of talks (about art! compilers! type theory! assembly! games!)</li>
<li>by a good mix of experienced and new speakers</li>
<li>which were very well presented. The quality was even higher than I
expected, and I&rsquo;d worked on reviewing the proposals!</li>
</ul>

<p></p>

<p>Several people told us that they liked the anonymous review because
they were confident they&rsquo;d be judged fairly on the merits of their
proposal.</p>

<p>One of our accepted speakers,
<a href="https://twitter.com/hypotext">Katherine Ye</a>, told us:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Thank you so much for [anonymizing everything]! It&rsquo;s a relief to
know that I wasn&rsquo;t picked for gender, race, age, or anything like
that.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I would happily do anonymous review again. It was great.</p>

<h3 id="outreach-to-women">Outreach to women.</h3>

<p>This is going to be a whole separate post, since we worked really hard
on this. Basically: about 30-40% of our talk submissions were from
women, and 40% of the talks we accepted were by women. We didn&rsquo;t
measure other axes of diversity (like race/class/other things).
There&rsquo;s a lot of room for improvement.</p>

<h3 id="168-proposals">168 proposals!!!</h3>

<p>We were blown away by how many people submitted talks. And we only had
space for 24 talks! We had to make super hard decisions, and we didn&rsquo;t
have much time.</p>

<h3 id="talk-review-letter-grades">Talk review: Letter grades</h3>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/lindsey">Lindsey</a> suggested
<a href="http://scg.unibe.ch/download/champion/#PATTERN5">this way of managing review</a>
after having seen it at academic conferences. Each of us assigned a
proposal a letter grade (A-D), from &ldquo;I will fight for this talk&rdquo;, to
&ldquo;I will fight for this talk to be <em>rejected</em>&rdquo;. We then looked at the
highest &amp; lowest grade for each talk and binned them into AA, AB, AC,
AD, BB, BC, BD, CC, CD, DD. We rejected any talk that didn&rsquo;t have an
A.</p>

<p>If I knew who a proposal was by, I abstained from reviewing it (so
hard!).</p>

<p>This left us with maybe 80 talks that at least one person thought was
excellent-sounding. Still too many!</p>

<h3 id="github-issues-for-discussion">GitHub issues for discussion</h3>

<p>We then used GitHub to discuss talk proposals. We put each talk into
an GitHub issue, and tagged them. Here are the tags we used.</p>

<ul>
<li><code>AA</code> - <code>AD</code> Letter grade ranking</li>
<li><code>accept</code> - Accepted</li>
<li><code>reject</code> - Rejected</li>
<li><code>has-advocate</code> - Someone has advocated this talk in the comments</li>
<li><code>reject-advocate</code> - Someone has argued for rejecting this talk in
the comments</li>
<li>a category: (work/fun/science/product/art/proglang/other)</li>
</ul>

<p>To be accepted, a talk needed an <em>advocate</em> &ndash; someone who would argue
for it to be accepted. Once it had an advocate, we would discuss its
merits in a video chat and decide whether to accept or reject it.</p>

<p>We did that, and after much sadness (what do you mean this is still
too many talks! We can&rsquo;t accept three talks about the Curry-Howard
isomorphism!), we had a program!.</p>

<h3 id="super-personal-responses">Super-personal responses</h3>

<p>Alex, our Chief Anonymizer, did not only do an amazing job of
anonymizing! Not at all. We got a ton of submissions that we would
have <em>loved</em> to accept if we&rsquo;d had more space.</p>

<p>So Alex sent personal emails to people whose talks we rejected saying
how interesting he thought their talks were and which parts
specifically he liked.</p>

<p>If your talk got rejected, you should consider submitting it to
another conference! We probably loved it.</p>

<h3 id="amazing-results">Amazing results</h3>

<p>My favorite things about anonymous talk review were</p>

<ul>
<li>it gave the speakers more confidence that they&rsquo;d be judged fairly</li>
<li>it was impossible to accept less-interesting-sounding talks just
because they were &ldquo;by someone famous&rdquo;. There were amazing talks by
people who had never spoken at a conference before.</li>
<li>it was impossible to give preferential treatment to our friends!
This was a bit sad (some of my friends submitted talks that I knew
were great, and were rejected, and I couldn&rsquo;t do anything), but it
made the conference better.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the <a href="http://bangbangcon.com/program.html">final program</a>. There
was weaving! Assembly! How serial protocols work! Logic programming!
Hacking poetry! Robots dancing! Python&rsquo;s 1500-line switch statement!
All of the speakers did an amazing job &ndash; I think for every single
talk I heard someone say &ldquo;Wow, that was my favorite talk!&rdquo;</p>

<p>None of this is to say that anonymous review is the best way to do
talk review. PyCon does not do anonymous review at all, and I think
they do a great job. But it worked very well for us.</p>
