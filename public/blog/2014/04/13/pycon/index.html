     <p>PyCon 2014 happened! It was my first time at PyCon, I expected to have
a good time, and it was better than I expected. I spoke! People came
up to me and said they enjoyed my talk! There were so many amazing
talks! I met so many people whose work I&rsquo;d been following! <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub> of the
talks were by women! It was <em>wonderful</em>.</p>

<p>A few talks that especially stood out to me, or that I missed and
<em>really</em> want to see. I didn&rsquo;t see anything like all the talks, but I
liked these. In no particular order:</p>

<p></p>

<p><small>
Not all of the videos are up yet, but I&rsquo;ll come back to this later and
put in video links when they are.
</small></p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/ctitusbrown">Titus Brown</a> gave a wonderful talk
about his work in computationally intensive biology. I found this
particularly interesting because he offered roughly &ldquo;I have harder
data problems that your tech job does! Come do a PhD with me and
I&rsquo;ll pay you a fraction as much.&rdquo; This was oddly compelling. Very
much worth watching.
<a href="http://ivory.idyll.org/blog/2014-pycon.html">Notes from his talk</a>,
<a href="http://pyvideo.org/video/2697/data-intensive-biology-in-the-cloud-instrumentin">[Video]</a></li>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/juliepagano">Julie Pagano</a> gave
<a href="https://us.pycon.org/2014/schedule/presentation/164/">advice about battling imposter syndrome</a>.
I liked that her advice was practical! We need better advice than
&ldquo;you shouldn&rsquo;t have imposter syndrome!&rdquo;, and this did well at that.
<a href="http://pyvideo.org/video/2659/its-dangerous-to-go-alone-battling-the-invisibl">[Video]</a></li>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/jessicamckellar">Jessica McKellar</a>&rsquo;s keynote on how we can help advance computer
science education was amazing. It was amazing because she gave so
many concrete suggestions and specific calls to action: there were
easy things (for example: call your legislators and tell them CS
should count for AP math/science credit!) and larger commitments.
She challenged everyone to do just one thing in the upcoming year to
try to make CS education in high school better.
<a href="http://pyvideo.org/video/2684/keynote-jessica-mckellar">[Video]</a></li>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/fperez_org">Fernando Perez</a> spoke about the
state of Python for scientific and how scientists are using IPython
to easily make their work reproducible. I&rsquo;m so impressed with the
community he&rsquo;s building around this software. The tools are so good
and getting better so quickly.
<a href="http://pyvideo.org/video/2683/keynote-fernando-perez">[Video]</a></li>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/NaomiCeder">Naomi Ceder</a> spoke about
<a href="https://us.pycon.org/2014/schedule/presentation/182/">being a trans woman in the Python community</a>.
I saw so many positive comments about her talk on Twitter
afterwards. I&rsquo;m really interested to see what she has to say, and
delighted that I work in a community where her perspective is
valued.
<a href="http://pyvideo.org/video/2671/farewell-and-welcome-home-python-in-two-genders">[Video]</a></li>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/paultag">Paul Tagliamonte</a>&rsquo;s talk about
<a href="https://us.pycon.org/2014/schedule/presentation/192/">compiling Lisp to Python bytecode</a>
was the kind of excited &ldquo;let&rsquo;s see how far we can take this crazy
idea!&rdquo; talk that I really enjoy. Super enjoyable speaker.
<a href="http://pyvideo.org/video/2616/getting-hy-on-python-how-to-implement-a-lisp-fro">[Video]</a></li>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/hsjuju2">Julie Lavoie</a> talked about
<a href="https://us.pycon.org/2014/schedule/presentation/179/">Analyzing Rap Lyrics with Python</a>.
I liked this because she clearly loves rap, and she gave some
background on rap as an art form, including samples from different
styles. Also it was a super fun introduction to natural language
processing.
<a href="http://pyvideo.org/video/2658/analyzing-rap-lyrics-with-python">[Video]</a></li>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/tavarm">Tavish Armstrong</a> talked about one of
his favorite topics: how programmers can learn from software
engineering research. His call to action: Try to measure something
about your software engineering practice! Show it to your friends!
Reproduce it! Give a talk at PyCon next year about it!
<a href="http://pyvideo.org/video/2696/software-engineering-research-for-hackers-bridgi">[Video]</a></li>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/akaptur">Allison Kaptur</a> explained how
<a href="https://us.pycon.org/2014/schedule/presentation/229/">import works in Python, from the ground up</a>.
I loved that she started with a naive version of import and kept
incrementally improving it until we got to a version that resembles
how <code>import</code> actually works.
<a href="http://pyvideo.org/video/2567/import-ant-decisions">[Video]</a></li>
<li>I talked about why IPython Notebook and Pandas are my favorite tools
for exploratory data analysis, and people said they enjoyed how
enthusiastic I was afterwards. Yay!

<p>A few more talks that I want to watch the videos for, but can&rsquo;t
comment on because, well, I haven&rsquo;t yet.</p>

<p>I never stop being impressed with people I meet at PyCon. Conferences
are so hard! I want to meet all the people and do all the things and
be in 3 places at things. And the sprints haven&rsquo;t even happened yet!</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m so thankful to all the organizers for doing so much work to make
this possible. The conference chair
<a href="https://twitter.com/diana_clarke">Diana Clarke</a> got a standing
ovation at the closing session, and more than deserved it.</p>

<p>♥ PyCon.</p>
