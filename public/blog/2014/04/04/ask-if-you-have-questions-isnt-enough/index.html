     <p>I&rsquo;ve helped out and taught at a few programming workshops for
beginners now, and I&rsquo;ve noticed something. There are always helpers
who have tons of experience and are super willing to answer questions.
And there&rsquo;s always an announcement where someone says &ldquo;Here are the
helpers! They are here just to help you. Raise your hand if you have
questions!&ldquo;.</p>

<p>And it&rsquo;s not enough. Inevitably people will not ask because they&rsquo;re
scared or they think it&rsquo;s their fault and then they&rsquo;ll get stuck.</p>

<p>Here are some things I try to do when I help out at workshops.</p>

<p></p>

<ul>
<li>Circulate! Ask people &ldquo;hey are you okay? Everything working well?&rdquo;</li>
<li>If everybody&rsquo;s saying yes, some of them are not okay and just not
telling you. Ask more questions! &ldquo;How are you finding it so far?&rdquo;.
If you talk to someone for a minute sometimes they&rsquo;ll come out with
&ldquo;well everything is fine but this weird thing is happening&hellip; can
you take a look?&rdquo;</li>
<li>Watch out for confused faces and sad people! Go talk to people with
confused faces and try to see how they&rsquo;re doing!</li>
<li>Keep asking the same people if they&rsquo;re okay over and over again. If
you keep talking to them, they&rsquo;ll be much more likely to ask you
when they <em>do</em> have a problem.</li>
<li>When someone raises their hand I have a lot of dialogues like this:

<ul>
<li>Hey I have a ques-</li>
<li>GREAT. I LOVE QUESTIONS. WHAT IS YOUR QUESTION</li>
<li><em>question question</em></li>
<li>That&rsquo;s definitely something we can solve! Oh that&rsquo;s actually a
mistake in the directions! That&rsquo;s totally our fault! Sorry about
that!</li>
</ul></li>
<li>I really do like answering programming questions, so I act super
excited about it. I think/hope this makes it easier for people to
ask me because they don&rsquo;t feel like it&rsquo;s a burden.</li>
<li>A script: I love questions! We can solve that for sure! Lots of
other people are having that problem! You&rsquo;re doing great! I&rsquo;m happy
you&rsquo;re here!</li>
</ul>

<p>It feels weird to ask the same people if they&rsquo;re doing okay over and
over and over and over and over again, but I think it really does
help.</p>

<p>This feels more effective and like a better use of my time as a helper
than standing in the corner waiting for someone to flag me down. And
more fun!</p>
