<div class="entry-content">
     <p>In the last month I&rsquo;ve done what feels like 100 interviews. It&rsquo;s
easier than I thought it would be. I&rsquo;m getting much better at talking
about myself to strangers on the phone, which is an awesome thing to
be able to practice. It&rsquo;s also interesting to see different approaches
to interviewing and get a feel for the culture at the companies.</p>

<p>I feel like at some point someone&rsquo;s going to ask me what kind of
questions get asked in technical interviews. So here are some
anecdotes. This is probably from 15-30 technical interviews / phone
screens, across a bunch of tech companies of different sizes. (the
number depends on how you count interviews)</p>

<p></p>

<h2 id="questions-about-my-background">Questions about my background</h2>

<p>Most people ask me variations on these questions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Tell me a bit about your background.</li>
<li>Tell me a bit about <a href="from my resume">Job X</a></li>
<li>What are you looking for in a job?</li>
<li>Do you have any questions for me?</li>
</ul>

<p>I was originally pretty intimidated by all these questions, but I
think they&rsquo;re actually a gift (if initially a difficult gift).</p>

<p><strong>&ldquo;Tell me about your background&rdquo;</strong> gives you a chance to tell a story
  about your career so far and explain where you&rsquo;re coming from a
  little bit. I find it useful enough that now if somebody doesn&rsquo;t
  ask, I&rsquo;ll often say &ldquo;alright, let me tell you a bit about where I&rsquo;m
  coming from&rdquo; at the beginning of a first phone interview with a
  company. I probably talk for 2-5 minutes.</p>

<p>For me this looks like &ldquo;I went to school and I did X, and then I
wanted to change it up a bit so I did a job doing Y, but I wanted a
bit more Q in my career so I switched to industry Z&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s good to
talk about your accomplishments here.</p>

<p>For <strong>&ldquo;Tell me a bit about [Job X]&rdquo;</strong>, I make sure I can talk about
projects I worked on at each of my previous jobs in an engaging way.
I&rsquo;ve also had people ask me about my master&rsquo;s thesis, so I make sure I
can explain that.</p>

<p>Some good things to talk about would be</p>

<ul>
<li>What was the goal of the project?</li>
<li>What was interesting about the project?</li>
<li>What did you accomplish? Why was it a success?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>What are you looking for in a job?</strong> is a bit tough to give pithy
  answers to, but good! It&rsquo;s also a good thing to think about for
  myself, so preparing for a question like this is definitely a good
  use of time.</p>

<p><strong>Do you have any questions for me?</strong> is something I&rsquo;ve thought about
  a lot, and wrote about in
  <a href="http://jvns.ca/blog/2013/12/30/questions-im-asking-in-interviews/">Questions I&rsquo;m asking in interviews</a>.
  I may write more about this later because it&rsquo;s really important and
  I find it pretty hard to get right.</p>

<h2 id="technical-questions">Technical questions</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been asked exactly zero tricky math questions or questions like
&ldquo;How many bingo balls could fit in the Empire State Building&rdquo;.
Hopefully the tech industry has gotten over these.</p>

<p>Here are some kinds of questions people have asked me:</p>

<ul>
<li>I saw <a href="http://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a> on your resume! That sounds
cool! Tell me about it!</li>
<li>Tell me what happens when you go to
<a href="http://google.com">http://google.com</a>, in as much detail as you
can.</li>
<li>Write code to solve this [non-tricky but not trivial] algorithm
program. (either in a Google doc or write code that will actually
run on my computer)</li>
<li>Tell me more about your
<a href="https://github.com/jvns/teeceepee">TCP stack</a>! (+ more followup
questions)</li>
<li>Statistics questions, when applying for jobs that involve data
analysis. Bayes&rsquo; theorem and things.</li>
<li>How would you approach [machine learning problem]?</li>
<li>Tell me about some performance problems you&rsquo;ve dealt with and what
you did.</li>
<li>Algorithm question, and

<ul>
<li>Tell me an algorithm for this.</li>
<li>Talk about the complexity.</li>
<li>How long do you think this would actually take to run, on a
billion numbers? (seconds/minutes/hours?)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>What do you know about distributed systems / concurrency? (+ some
followup)</li>
<li>What databases have you used? (+ some questions about database
design and query runtime)</li>
<li>What does <a href="http://d3js.org/">D3</a> do? What have you used it for?
Would you recommend using it for X?</li>
<li>Tell me about a project you did with
[specific technology from my resume]</li>
<li>Build a small class that does [thing].</li>
<li>Let&rsquo;s pair and fix a bug in a library!</li>
<li>Let&rsquo;s pair and write a simple classifier and evaluate it!</li>
<li>Bring some code you&rsquo;ve written and explain it to someone.</li>
<li>Write down code to do [thing] on a whiteboard. (only in one
interview, so far).</li>
<li>Some C-specific questions</li>
<li>Talk about a project you did where something was hard.</li>
</ul>

<p>Mostly nobody has asked me</p>

<ul>
<li>whiteboard coding</li>
<li>specific questions about how a programming language works</li>
</ul>

<p>I think people are replacing &ldquo;how many golf balls can fit in the
Empire State Building&rdquo; with more concrete questions about estimating
program runtime and space requirements. I am very happy about this.</p>

<p>One takeaway from all this is that having weird things like Rust and
Julia on my resume has been a fun time &ndash; people ask about Rust a lot,
and I get to have good conversations about it. They are in a short
&ldquo;things I know a little bit about&rdquo; section on my resume and it is
great.</p>
