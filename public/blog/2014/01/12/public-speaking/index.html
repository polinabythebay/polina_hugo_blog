     <p>I&rsquo;m working on preparing a talk for <a href="http://2014.cusec.net/">CUSEC</a>,
and I wanted to write down a few things on what I think about when I
submit and prepare talks.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m pretty new to all of this, but in 2013 I gave talks at PyCon
Canada and PyData NYC, as well as local user group meetups like
Montreal Python. And a bunch of short presentations at Hacker School.
I&rsquo;m a lot less scared of it than I used to be! It turns out it&rsquo;s kind
of fun!</p>

<p>The first order of business when preparing a talk is to convince
yourself that public speaking is a good idea and better than hiding
under the bed.
</p>

<p>One blog post that really motivated me when I was starting out was
this post by Hilary Mason on
<a href="http://www.hilarymason.com/speaking/why-you-an-introverted-nerd-should-try-public-speaking/">why introverts should do public speaking</a>.
She argues that if you&rsquo;re an introvert, public speaking is an
<em>excellent</em> idea because introducing yourself is a lot of work. If you
give a talk, you only have to introduce yourself to everyone once.</p>

<p>So far I&rsquo;ve found that giving talks improves my experience of a
conference a lot. It makes it easier to start conversations! People
will come up to me afterwards and we&rsquo;ll have a natural thing to talk
about. Also I get a speaker badge which is fun, and sometimes you get
in for free.</p>

<p>Another post I find useful when motivating myself is this one by Jen
Dzuira on how
<a href="http://www.thegloss.com/2013/07/24/career/bullish-life-inspiring-mediocrity-career/">mediocrity is inspiring</a>.
I often worry that my talks won&rsquo;t be as well-put-together and
inspiring as the best talks I&rsquo;ve ever seen. And they probably won&rsquo;t
be!</p>

<p>So I instead try to think about all the talks I&rsquo;ve seen that I found
boring, or that went over time, or that were badly organized, and
remember that I can definitely do better :). And that I have given
talks before and people have said nice things to me! Nobody has
ever said anything mean, which I take to mean that I am amazing and
can do no wrong.</p>

<p>Once I&rsquo;ve convinced myself that public speaking is a good idea and
that I can do a decent job of it, preparing talks is still hard! I
really really really really like this post
<a href="http://seriouspony.com/blog/2013/10/4/presentation-skills-considered-harmful">&ldquo;Presentation Skills Considered Harmful&rdquo;</a>
from the Serious Pony blog.</p>

<p>You should really just go read it, but she basically points out that
people don&rsquo;t care about you, they care about themselves. So it doesn&rsquo;t
matter if you&rsquo;re a &ldquo;good speaker&rdquo; and have awesome slides and socks
that match and perfect diction. All that matters is that you get
across information that makes the people you&rsquo;re talking to more
awesome.</p>

<p>Things like awesome slides and perfect diction sometimes help you
convey information better, but not necessarily! They might get in the
way!</p>

<p>This is also a great way to think about conference proposals. I try to
explain not &ldquo;why is this a good talk?&rdquo;, but &ldquo;if you come to this talk,
how will it make you better?&rdquo;</p>

<p>That is all! I think you should go read those blog posts and adjust
your beliefs as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>You should give talks!</li>
<li>Lots of people have given kinda crappy talks. Yours can be better!</li>
<li>If you give people something they can use, everybody will love you!</li>
</ul>
