     <p>Last week I attended <a href="http://2014.cusec.net/">CUSEC</a>, an undergrad
conference for software engineers. They invited me to speak which was
super exciting, and there were a lot of great talks. I also got to
meet <a href="https://twitter.com/kelseyinnis">Kelsey Gilmore-Innis</a> and it
was pretty great.</p>

<p>Some of my favorite things:
</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.joshmatthews.net/">Josh Matthews</a> gave a great
introductory talk on how to contribute to Firefox. I liked how he
gave some concrete examples of small patches. He also showed off
<a href="http://whatcanidoformozilla.org/">http://whatcanidoformozilla.org/</a>,
which I hadn&rsquo;t heard of before. You can see the
<a href="http://www.joshmatthews.net/cusec14/">slides</a> on his website, and
they have tons of detail. He really made the Mozilla community sound
friendly and welcoming and it was great.</li>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/kelseyinnis">Kelsey Gilmore-Innis</a> talked about
how functional programming isn&rsquo;t scary and the reasons she liked it.
I liked how she pushed back against the notion that functional
programs are unreadable &ndash; she pointed out that people who write
imperative programs spend a lot of time learning how to read for
loops, and learning how to read <code>map</code> is similar. Food for thought
for sure.</li>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/avibryant">Avi Bryant</a> gave an
easy-to-understand-for-me introduction to HyperLogLog and talked
about how we can often write better programs if we write them
probabilistically. Fun!</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="http://twitter.com/notwaldorf">Monica</a>,
<a href="https://twitter.com/kelseyinnis">Kelsey</a>, and a few other people put
together something we called CUSECLadies. Basically we invited all the
women students at CUSEC to meet up with us (women with programming
jobs and a few years&rsquo; experience on them) and had a big group
discussion. We talked about salary negotiation, whether or not women
stay in tech, how we all got into programming, people&rsquo;s experiences in
school, whether we identify as feminists, advice for talking to
companies at job fairs, the role of women-only groups, and a whole
bunch of other things.</p>

<p>It was totally unplanned, but I think/hope people got something out of
it.</p>

<p>I also gave a talk! It was called &ldquo;You can be a kernel hacker!&rdquo; and it
was 100% the most fun talk I have given so far. Here are
<a href="http://bit.ly/kernelfun">links to the resources</a> I talked about.</p>

<p>A whole bunch of delightful people came up to me after and told me
that they now feel like they know what a kernel is and how to get
started with kernel programming! What a world =D</p>

<p>My favorite new talk tactic (thanks to
<a href="http://twitter.com/notwaldorf">Monica</a>) is to gray out everything
irrelevant when showing code samples. Here&rsquo;s an example:</p>

<p>Before:</p>

<p><img src="/images/chmod-code.png"></p>

<p>After:</p>

<p><img src="/images/chmod-code-crossed-out.png"></p>

<p>I found that this really helped with the cognitive load of code
samples and made showing kernel code much less intimidating. The
technical term for this is &ldquo;eraser eyes&rdquo;.</p>
