     <p>I wrote up what it was like to be working remote
<a href="http://jvns.ca/blog/2014/06/06/working-remote/">3 months after I started</a>.
5 months later, I have some new thoughts!</p>

<p>The worst thing about working remotely so far has just been feeling
generally alienated. I talked a little about motivation in
<a href="http://jvns.ca/blog/2014/04/26/i-dont-feel-guilty-about-not-contributing-to-open-source/">Don&rsquo;t feel guilty about not contributing to open source</a>,
where I mentioned a theory that motivation is made up of
<strong>competence</strong> (I know how to do this!), <strong>autonomy</strong> (I can make my
own decisions!), and <strong>relatedness</strong> (I know why Iâ€™m doing this!).</p>

<p>It turns out that a) this is called
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-determination_theory">self-determination theory</a>,
and b) I totally misunderstood what &ldquo;relatedness&rdquo; meant. It turns out
that relatedness is actually about feeling connected to the people
about you (&ldquo;the universal want to interact, be connected to, and
experience caring for others&rdquo;). It&rsquo;s the opposite of feeling alienated
:)</p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t visit the office for 4 months and that was a mistake! Turns
out that if I don&rsquo;t see a group of people for way too long then it&rsquo;s
easy to feel like nobody cares about me and everything I do is
terrible, and it has all kinds of strange negative unforeseen
consequences. Visiting SF for a while made everything approximately
100x better. In gifs (of course) seeing people can be the difference
between:</p>

<p><img src="/images/sad-panda-julia.gif"></p>

<p>and</p>

<p><img src="/images/happy-julia.gif"></p>

<p>Right now I feel a lot more like gif #2, which is pretty great.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Visiting the office lets me</p>

<ul>
<li>meet new people who have joined since I last visited</li>
<li>remember how much I like so many of the people I work with (wow hi
wow we work in the same place wow you&rsquo;re really great wow)</li>
<li>have super productive in-person meetings</li>
<li>have all the lunches and coffees and walks</li>
<li>just generally feel like a human that other humans know about and
like (are people happy to see me? HOW CAN IT BE WOW)</li>
</ul>

<p>Some new disconnected thoughts:</p>

<ul>
<li>When I started, being in a different timezone (EST vs PST) was hard
because I would get stuck on things in the morning. Being in a
different timezone now basically doesn&rsquo;t matter at all. It means I
have some uninterrupted time to work in the morning, and then can
talk to people as they trickle in in the afternoon</li>
<li>My team is super easy to communicate with via IM. This is basically
the best.</li>
<li>6 people are working remote right now (up from 3), which is pretty
great. And 3 of them are in my timezone!</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s basically impossible to learn about how the office &lsquo;feels&rsquo;
while remote. Working from SF feels totally different from working
from my house. This is okay, but it&rsquo;s always surprising to me how
different it is when I&rsquo;m there.</li>
<li>Jobs just get easier after doing them for a while. Now I know more
things so lots of things are easier and better.</li>
<li>People have suggested all kinds of remote work routines to me. Some
of these are helpful to me, and some of them aren&rsquo;t!</li>
<li>as with anything, finding things that work is just trial and error.
Lots of error :)</li>
</ul>

<p>New strategies:</p>

<ul>
<li>having a bunch of 1:1 weekly meetings with people I&rsquo;m working with
is really great. It means I get to talk to them without having a
scheduled agenda which is hard to do sometimes. I want to make a few
more of these!</li>
<li>visit SF often enough</li>
<li>leave the house every day, and shower every morning :) :) :) :). I
have an Extremely Patient Partner who walks me to a cafe in the
mornings to get me out of the house, which is the greatest.</li>
</ul>

<p>Overall I really like the people I work with and the things I work on
and am happy that I get to work with them without having to move to
San Francisco. Yay!</p>
