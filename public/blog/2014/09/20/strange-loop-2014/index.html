     <p>I spent some of last week at
<a href="https://thestrangeloop.com/">Strange Loop</a>. I met lots of new
curious, friendly, wonderful people, gave a talk that people really
liked, played board games with friends, and generally had a great
time.</p>

<p>It was also kind of a big deal for me personally! A year and a half
ago I gave
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JJ102ZpoH0">my first lightning talk at a meetup</a>,
and was super scared. I&rsquo;ve heard a lot about how great of a conference
Strange Loop was, and I really wouldn&rsquo;t have anticipated then that</p>

<ul>
<li>I&rsquo;d get to go</li>
<li>they&rsquo;d accept a talk I submitted (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IQlpFWTFbM">&ldquo;You can be a kernel hacker!&rdquo;</a>)</li>
<li>the room would be packed</li>
<li>people would say things like &ldquo;that was my favorite talk of the
conference&rdquo;</li>
</ul>

<p>I always imagine cool developer conferences like Strange Loop as being
full of wizard developers who know everything about programming. I
was worried that my talk would be too entry-level (I explain what a
kernel is / what a system call is from the ground up, for instance).</p>

<p>It turned out <strong>tons</strong> of people there didn&rsquo;t know a lot about systems
programming / how kernels work, and my choice to make the talk
accessible made a lot of people happy. So far I&rsquo;ve given a bunch of
talks and I&rsquo;ve never regretted trying to make it easy to follow for as
many people as possible.</p>

<p></p>

<p>I collected
<a href="https://storify.com/jvns/you-can-be-a-kernel-hacker-comments">some of the comments from Twitter</a>
to keep me happy on sad days. (also: super useful for convincing
people they should have me speak when submitting future talk
proposals!)</p>

<h3 id="talks-to-watch">talks to watch</h3>

<p>A few wonderful talks that I think are worth watching:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhguOt863nw">Concurrency Options on the JVM</a> by
<a href="http://twitter.com/jessitron">Jessica Kerr</a> was a wonderful
overview of concurrency models in various JVM languages (Akka,
core.async, futures, &hellip;), what tradeoffs they have, and how to
think about them. Every time I&rsquo;ve seen her speak I&rsquo;ve been
impressed.</li>
<li>How Julia Goes Fast by <a href="http://twitter.com/astrieanna">Leah Hanson</a>
was a solid introduction to the choices the Julia language has made
in order to perform well for numerical computations, and how to
write your own fast Julia programs. For some reason the video isn&rsquo;t
up yet.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmImGiVuJno">Benchmarking: You&rsquo;re Doing It Wrong</a> by
<a href="http://twitter.com/aysylu">Aysylu Greenberg</a> was a <em>wonderful</em> talk
explaining common errors people make when benchmarking, and laying
out strategies for writing better benchmarks. The next time I need
to make a benchmark I will absolutely watch this talk.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdkS6ZjeR7Q">Jepsen II: Linearizable Boogaloo</a> by
<a href="http://twitter.com/aphyr">Kyle Kingsbury</a> was wonderful, as all of
his talks are. The room was packed, and he struck a great balance
between discussing serious problems he&rsquo;d found in distributed
systems (in this case RabbitMQ and Elastic Search), and
acknowledging that the developers who work on large distributed
systems are solving a <em>really hard problem</em>. The message wasn&rsquo;t that
people building distributed systems are doing bad work, but that we
need to be honest about the tradeoffs that the systems we build are
making, and document known problems. For instance, Elastic Search is
a great search engine, but you should absolutely not use it as a
primary datastore because it can lose your data.</li>
</ul>

<p>Talks I heard good things about, and am planning to watch the videos
of later:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJpb1j2SWfA">Art.js: Transfigure data to Create 21st Century Art</a>
by Sarah Palermo</li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4Gsl8sVgdQ">The Sociology of Programming Languages</a>
by Leo Meyerovich (a talk about programming
language that involves an actual study, with data, of how people
choose programming languages! How can it be!)</li>
<li>I have hard nothing but rave reviews of
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEBzS9tpmTo">Practical Fractals in Space</a>
by Michelle Brush</li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4i7KrG1Afbk">Idris: Practical Dependent Types with Practical Examples</a>
by Brian McKenna was described to me as &ldquo;types from space&rdquo;. I&rsquo;m not a
huge type theory nerd, but this sounded like a fun talk to watch.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CKru5d4GPk">Spreadsheets for developers</a> by Felienne Hermans is by someone who has
a <strong>PhD in spreadsheets</strong>. How cool is that? I have every regret
about not watching this talk.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjYAnBhF2JU">Towards &ldquo;annex&rdquo;, a Fact Based Dependency System</a> by Mark Hibberd</li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5HyVUPuU0E">Simulation Testing</a> by
Michael Nygard</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="inclusive-yay">inclusive yay</h3>

<p>Strange Loop tried really hard to be more inclusive this year. Bridget
Hillyer wrote a great
<a href="http://bridgetconsulting.com/?p=131">wrap up post</a>. The most striking
thing to me was this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>[We engaged Ashe Dryden to help us come up with a plan]. I took that
plan and made a list of the steps included. I assumed Alex Miller
and I would prioritize them and decide what we could actually pull
off. Alex said we should do <em>all</em> of them. There were 58 items on
that list. Plus, Alex did many things beyond what was on that list
to make the conference more accessible and comfortable for all
involved.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I love the idea of taking a huge list of ideas to make a conference
more inclusive and just doing every single one. There were tons of
women at the conference, and a lot of my favorite talks were by women.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve become pretty used to spaces with lots of women developers in
them after Hacker School, so I didn&rsquo;t find the number of women
super surprising (of <strong>course</strong> there are tons of awesome women who write
code! that&rsquo;s how it <em>always is</em>). 12% doesn&rsquo;t even feel like a lot to
me! But it was pretty great, and I got to meet a bunch of old and new
friends.</p>

<h3 id="types">types</h3>

<p>One small thing that I saw at Strange Loop that I <em>didn&rsquo;t</em> like was a
couple of talks making the following argument:</p>

<ul>
<li>languages with static type systems prevent a class of errors that
dynamic type systems don&rsquo;t</li>
<li>therefore those languages are safer</li>
<li>therefore if you&rsquo;re writing mission critical systems, you should use
static typing</li>
</ul>

<p>This class of argument really bothers me, because it doesn&rsquo;t really
hold up in court by itself. I <em>love</em> using static type checking, and I
would love to see evidence that statically typed programs actually
have less bugs.</p>

<p>But this argument by itself isn&rsquo;t that great. Strange Loop is a
conference where we have a really unique combination of academics and
developers with lots of industry experience. We could talk about this
in a more nuanced way!</p>

<ul>
<li>are there studies with evidence that static type checking reduces
the number of bugs?</li>
<li>what about the claim that dynamic languages are faster to develop
in? Do we have any evidence for that?</li>
</ul>

<p>Or I&rsquo;d love to see some analysis of case studies about organization
that have made a big switch (like Twitter&rsquo;s switch to Scala, for
instance), by someone without an agenda to push (like &ldquo;wow Scala is
great!&ldquo;).</p>

<p>It basically seemed like there were talks by people who really liked
static languages, and talks by people who really liked dynamic
languages, and they were just talking past each other. I didn&rsquo;t learn
anything new from these talks.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d like to go back next year and see better arguments. See you next
year, Strange Loop! &lt;3</p>
