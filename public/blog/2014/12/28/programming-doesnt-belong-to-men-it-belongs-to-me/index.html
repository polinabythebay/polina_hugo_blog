     <p>One thing I&rsquo;ve noticed since I started writing this blog is that I&rsquo;ll
get comments like these on my posts: (all these people are talking about
me)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>He&rsquo;s only using the -Ofast gcc option, I wonder what he would get with
-march=native -mtune=native which allows the compiler to use more
instructions.</p>

<p>But more interestingly, why is he studying the amalgated C file
 instead of, you know, the sources?</p>

<p>I think he talks about the actual .db file?</p>

<p>How would each machine/core&rsquo;s counts know when they are done? If he
wants a max of a million counts wouldn&rsquo;t each machine have to check
the counts of each other machine before continuing?</p>

<p>If you change the OP&rsquo;s problem to summing a vector of floating point
numbers, then even the way he has coded it there will still be
differences from run to run.</p>

<p>One thing he doesn&rsquo;t mention is the fear of looking stupid.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When this happens, when people implicitly assume that a Technical Thing
On The Internet must be written by a man, I find it confusing. I didn&rsquo;t
grow up with the idea that I was worse at math or programming than the
men around me (because, well, I wasn&rsquo;t!) And I didn&rsquo;t grow up with the
idea that it was weird for me to write programs (why would it be?). And
a huge number of the programmers I know and respect are women.</p>

<p>So the idea that programmers are all men or that programming is for men
or that an article about the Linux kernel is probably written by a man
just seems&hellip; silly to me. I feel like the community <em>belongs to me</em>,
and like I&rsquo;m a part of it.</p>

<p>And when people who have more power push marginalized people out of
tech, I think, who do you think you are? Why do you think this belongs
to you, and that you have the right to say who can come and who can&rsquo;t?</p>

<p>Programming doesn&rsquo;t belong to men, or to people who went to MIT, or to
white people, or to English-speakers, or to Linux users, or to C
programmers, or to people with CS degrees, or to people who are
self-taught, or to people who can see, or to people who had easy access
to computers when they were young. If you write programs, it belongs to
you.</p>
