     <p>In my first programming job, I worked at a <a href="http://evolvingweb.ca">web development company</a>
and wrote modules for <a href="https://drupal.org">Drupal</a> sites.</p>

<p>Every so often, I&rsquo;d need to understand some specific Drupal edge case
(say, how the text in the tabs on a search page was determined). And it
wouldn&rsquo;t be documented. And Stack Overflow didn&rsquo;t have any answers about
it, and my <a href="http://twitter.com/tavarm">colleagues</a> didn&rsquo;t know. I like
to think of this as a &ldquo;oh right I actually need to know how to program&rdquo;
moment &ndash; nobody&rsquo;s going to tell me what to do, I just need to figure it
out.</p>

<p>The consultancy&rsquo;s cofounder was <a href="https://twitter.com/dergachev">Alex Dergachev</a>,
and he taught me a really important thing! Whenever I had a question
like this, he&rsquo;d tell me to just read Drupal&rsquo;s source code, and then I&rsquo;d
know the answer. This is pretty obvious in retrospect, but it wasn&rsquo;t
obvious to me at the time.</p>

<p>I originally felt like Drupal was too complicated to understand (it&rsquo;s a
big codebase!), but it turned out that if I tried I could usually figure
out what I needed to know.</p>

<p>This works particularly well when I understand pretty well what the code
I&rsquo;m using is doing, but am just unsure about some particular detail.
For example &ldquo;will this button appear for all users, or only admin
users?&rdquo; I use this all the time at work, and most of you probably do
too! There are always details about code that aren&rsquo;t exhaustively
documented, and using grep to find answers is incredibly helpful.</p>

<h3 id="but-sometimes-reading-the-code-doesn-t-work">But sometimes reading the code doesn&rsquo;t work.</h3>

<p></p>

<p>Recently I was writing a map reduce job, and there was an out of memory
error. And it wasn&rsquo;t really obvious why, and I tried to look at the
stack trace and read some relevant parts of the source code. And it
just. did not. help. at. all.</p>

<p>It turned out that I was doing a join, and the rows on the right side of
the join were too big, and this was causing
<a href="http://www.cascading.org/">Cascading</a> to be sad. But to understand
that, it was important to understand how Cascading joins worked! And I
didn&rsquo;t know that at all. Thankfully I work with
<a href="https://twitter.com/avibryant">people</a>
<a href="https://twitter.com/jeffbalogh">who</a>
<a href="https://twitter.com/colinmarc">know</a>
<a href="https://twitter.com/DanielleSucher">things</a>
I don&rsquo;t know about Hadoop and they could help figure it out.</p>

<p>So it seems like there are a few different levels of bug difficulty:</p>

<ol>
<li>It&rsquo;s immediately obvious to you what&rsquo;s wrong</li>
<li>You Google the exception, read some documentation or Stack Overflow,
and then it&rsquo;s immediately obvious what&rsquo;s wrong</li>
<li>You don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s wrong, but you know more or less where in the
(open source) library code you&rsquo;re using to look, and you can read the
code to figure it out</li>
<li>You&rsquo;re missing some bigger-picture of knowledge about the code you&rsquo;re
running that you need to understand the bug (like me not
understanding how joins work in Cascading).</li>
</ol>

<p>I still struggle with approaching problems in #4 (especially if I
don&rsquo;t know that I don&rsquo;t know the Thing That I&rsquo;m Missing). For now, I
just
<a href="http://jvns.ca/blog/2014/06/13/asking-questions-is-a-superpower/http://jvns.ca/blog/2014/06/13/asking-questions-is-a-superpower/">ask</a>,
and often the people I work with have answers, and are really helpful.</p>

<p>I think if I couldn&rsquo;t do this, I&rsquo;d read a lot of documentation and hope
that some of it was relevant. I&rsquo;d love more ideas, though. Or if you
disagree with my hierarchy of bug difficulty that I made up 10 minutes
ago and have your own, I&rsquo;d love to know that too :) :)</p>
