     <p>Yesterday morning, I asked on Twitter:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Does anyone have good writing about fear + programming (and how being
afraid to make important changes makes you a worse programmer?)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I feel like there&rsquo;s this really important line between caution (a++
excellent) and fear (which holds you back from doing necessary work)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A lot of <a href="https://twitter.com/b0rk/status/546376386672611329">super interesting discussion ensued</a>, and I&rsquo;d
like to talk about some of it.</p>

<p>Before I start, <a href="https://twitter.com/rckenned">Ryan Kennedy</a> linked me
to this slide deck of a presentation he gave called
<a href="https://speakerdeck.com/ryankennedy/fear-driven-development">Fear Driven Development</a>
which I absolutely loved, and I think you should look at it. I think my
favorite sentence from that presentation is <strong>&ldquo;Fear creates local
maximums.&rdquo;</strong></p>

<p>I find that when I&rsquo;m afraid, I become super conservative. WE CANNOT
POSSIBLY MAKE THIS CHANGE WHAT IF IT BREAKS?! And this means worse
software! It&rsquo;s actually kind of disastrous. If you&rsquo;re scared of making
changes, you can&rsquo;t make something dramatically better, or do that big
code cleanup. Maybe you can&rsquo;t even deploy the code that you already
wrote and tested, because it feels too scary. You just want to stick
what&rsquo;s sort-of-working, even if it&rsquo;s not great.</p>

<p></p>

<h2 id="better-tools-process-less-fear">Better tools &amp; process =&gt; less fear</h2>

<p>A lot of people brought up tools and processes. (in particular the
fantastic <a href="https://twitter.com/kelseyinnis">Kelsey Gilmore-Innis</a>, who
has new-to-me things to say about better processes for testing code
every time I talk to her)</p>

<p>Kelsey:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I know you&rsquo;re talking more psychologically, but this is one of my main
reasons I believe investing in tests early is important</p>

<p>[&hellip;] obsessive monitoring, CI, canary deploys, chatops, dogfooding,
selfserve infra</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So! Here are a few ways tools and processes can make us less afraid:</p>

<p><strong>Version control</strong> means that you can make changes to your code without
being scared of losing the old version. This one is so basic to me now
&ndash; I can&rsquo;t even imagine how afraid I would be if I were programming
without version control.</p>

<p>So many people mentioned <strong>testing</strong> as a way to build confidence. My
favorite thing I&rsquo;ve ever read about testing is this book <a href="http://www.amazon.ca/Working-Effectively-Legacy-Michael-Feathers/dp/0131177052">Working
Effectively with Legacy
Code</a>,
where <a href="http://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/toc/0131177052/ref=dp_toc?ie=UTF8&amp;n=916520">every chapter
title</a>
is something that&rsquo;s scary or difficult about working with legacy code.
(He defines &ldquo;legacy code&rdquo; as &ldquo;code without tests&rdquo;, to give you a
flavor). For instance: &ldquo;I Don’t Understand the Code Well Enough To
Change It.&ldquo;, &ldquo;How Do I Know That I’m Not Breaking Anything?&rdquo;, &ldquo;I Don’t
Have Much Time and I Have To Change It.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This tweet from <a href="https://twitter.com/unclebobmartin/status/469536509822259200">Uncle Bob Martin</a>,
explains this idea pretty well:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Even with good design, w/o tests you will fear change and so the code
will rot.  With good tests, there’s no fear, so you’ll clean the code.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But testing and version control are not the only tools we have! We can
also build</p>

<ul>
<li>QA environments where breaking things is totally allowed and encouraged</li>
<li>deploys that go out a little bit at a time</li>
<li>the ability to roll back a deploy easily</li>
<li>QA teams, whose job it is to exhaustively test software</li>
<li>tools that will email you if your program throws exceptions</li>
</ul>

<p>and lots more.</p>

<h2 id="fear-of-retribution-and-blameless-postmortems">Fear of retribution (and blameless postmortems)</h2>

<p>But tools and processes are absolutely not the only thing. Even if I
have amazing tools and QA systems and the best deploy tools and
well-testing code, I&rsquo;m <strong>still going to make mistakes sometimes</strong>. And
what happens when I make a mistake is really critical.</p>

<p>Etsy and Google and Stripe (where I work) all have <a href="https://codeascraft.com/2012/05/22/blameless-postmortems/">blameless postmortems</a>.
This means that if you make a change and that change breaks something,
people talk about what happened by focusing on the change and the facts,
not on blaming you. (&ldquo;what about that change caused a problem?&rdquo; instead
of &ldquo;how did Julia break it?&rdquo;)</p>

<p>I also realized that this goes much further than programming, and
<a href="https://twitter.com/marcprecipice">Marc</a> linked me to
<a href="http://justcultureinstitute.com/">this amazing site about restorative justice</a>, which you should also go read.</p>

<p>So if you blame people for breaking things, they&rsquo;ll be more scared to
make changes in the future, and you&rsquo;ll end up with worse programs. Huh.</p>

<h2 id="irrational-fears">Irrational fears</h2>

<p>One last thing that that <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/ryankennedy/fear-driven-development">Fear Driven Development talk</a> talks
about that really resonated with me was &ndash; some fears are irrational,
and that they can <em>infect other people</em>. If you do a deploy, something
goes wrong, and you figure out the cause and fix the problem and nobody
yells at you, hopefully future deploys should not be scary!</p>

<p>But because we are only human and not Logical Robots, sometimes they
still are, and maybe you&rsquo;ll feel nervous about doing deploys for a while
until you see that things are really usually fine.</p>

<p>I think there&rsquo;s a lot more to be said about irrational fears, and I
would be interested to hear more.</p>

<p>This year was the first year that I worked on large software systems
that affect lots of people, and it&rsquo;s been scary sometimes! Next year
will be the second year, and my plan is for it to be easier =)</p>

excellent things and making me have new thoughts!)</p>
