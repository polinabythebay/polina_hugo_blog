     <p>spoiler: EVERYONE IS DIFFERENT AND PEOPLE THINK LOTS OF DIFFERENT
THINGS</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve read tons of articles about or by women who work as developers. I
read a thing yesterday and it was the best thing I&rsquo;ve ever read.
Yesterday I found a link to <a href="http://t.co/mgWCfII0Kn">a survey on Twitter</a>
asking for the experiences of women who work in technology, and did the
survey. There&rsquo;s question at the end that asks</p>

<p><strong>Any other comments you&rsquo;d like to make?</strong></p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t think much of it at the time &ndash; I said something (that I&rsquo;ve had
an incredibly good experience, but that it makes me very angry that
other people have bad experiences). But then I looked at <em>everyone
else&rsquo;s responses</em>. It&rsquo;s an amazing example of a wide range of women&rsquo;s
opinions and experiences, and I think you should read it. I&rsquo;ve formatted
<a href="https://gist.github.com/jvns/38c1c7572ce200a50227">all of the responses to that question</a> a little
better, or you can see
<a href="https://docs.google.com/a/stripe.com/forms/d/1TGGWz-BxClDC2LEpfon4Aib3Ac0kmnRtjLFLvIrrJc8/viewanalytics?usp=form_confirm">the full survey results</a>.</p>

<p></p>

<p>There are lots of negative comments, from women who are harassed or
disrespected at work. We have a lot of work to do. But there are also a
ton of very positive comments, from women who have supportive colleagues
and mentors and enjoy their work and who feel respected.</p>

<p>I also loved the answers to <strong>What do (or did) you like best about
working in tech?</strong>: the two most popular answers were <em>&ldquo;I enjoy the
actual work&rdquo;</em> and <em>&ldquo;I like solving problems that are really difficult&rdquo;</em>.
(about 75% of people). ME TOO THAT&rsquo;S HOW I FEEL &lt;3</p>

<p>Here are a few excerpts that I found particularly interesting: (though
basically every response is interesting, and I think you should read
them all.)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I feel that being female and over 40 has made my career feel much more
tenuous. I worry that if I lost my job I wouldn&rsquo;t be able to be hired
again in my field.</p>

<p>I personally have not had many issues arise due to gender, but I feel
this is largely because I tend to behave in a very male way by natural
inclination. I tend not to notice or be disturbed by behaviour many
women find inappropriate or intimidating. I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s rare or
acceptable, just not something I feel worried about for myself. It
does frustrate me a lot to see other women experience it though.</p>

<p>For years I could say I had never felt or been held back in tech
because of my gender. That is no longer the case.</p>

<p>I feel like I&rsquo;ve had things pretty easy, in part because I often get
along as &ldquo;one of the guys.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Currently very very happy in a great, friendly and supportive
environment (being female, a mother, and part-time hasn&rsquo;t stopped me
getting promoted) - so they do exist!</p>

<p>I have a <em>great</em> working environment. [&hellip;] Interestingly, we do have
 one engineer in particular who can be loud and overbearing and could,
 if given enough power, make the environment somewhat hostile &ndash; but
 that&rsquo;s exactly why no one gives him that power.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve experienced as much discrimination from female groups as I have
from male-dominated organizations.</p>

<p>As of this past September, I&rsquo;ve been 40 years in tech. It distresses
me that: 1. the situation of women in tech has gotten worse, but 2: a
lot of the women younger than I are behaving as if the problems
they&rsquo;re facing are new ones, and don&rsquo;t look to the past to see what
works/doesn&rsquo;t work, thereby losing traction by repeating some of our
(the older women&rsquo;s) mistakes!</p>

<p>I have been electrical engineer 31 years. Still feeling odd to be only
woman among colleagues</p>

<p>I feel more comfortable in a mostly-male environment. Probably because
that&rsquo;s how it was in my family, I had no sisters, but 3 brothers; and
my relationship with my mother wasn&rsquo;t as great.</p>

<p>I have no idea how much my male colleagues make. How are we supposed
to find that out?</p>

<p>I love this industry and I doubt I&rsquo;ll ever leave it, but it has a long
way to go in order for it to grow up.</p>

<p>While I definitely recognize that this is some (maybe even a lot of)
womens&rsquo; experience, I felt somewhat misled when directed here from
Twitter to take a survey about &ldquo;women in tech.&rdquo; Would love a survey
sometime to focus on us and all the cool stuff what we&rsquo;re actually
doing, rather than continuing to focus on aspects of tech that are
primary brought on by men.</p>

<p>i feel like my employer might look the same as a really bad one based
on the checkmarks but it is actually an overwhelmingly supportive env
and any inappropriate situations are dealt with very well. that they
come up in the first place is an industry wide issue - what
differentiates companies is how they handle it.</p>

<p>I feel extremely fortunate to had a very kind, feminist man as my
ph.d. supervisor. He made sure that myself and other aspiring women
scientists were able to attend professional development seminars that
were specifically aimed at helping women overcome gender-related
discrimination in our field. I hope that in my future career I can pay
it forward and help younger women advance their careers.</p>

<p>Ageism hits women harder than it does men.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s definitely &ldquo;bro-culture&rdquo; at work. If you&rsquo;re not one of the
bros, forget about going to lunch with upper management, getting that
raise, or getting the best projects. A female coworker of mine was
told to &ldquo;just sit and look pretty&rdquo; at a meeting once.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m very lucky that I work at a company that highly values equality
and works to make sure our environment is a healthy one for everyone,
with options for professional development and more.</p>

<p>I think I&rsquo;ve been quite fortunate in that I&rsquo;ve worked at companies
that encourage and support women in tech. There have been individual
male colleagues who have at times made work life difficult but I
always felt like the company had my back. These individuals were
spoken to by their managers and the issues were resolved.</p>

<p>Where&rsquo;s the option to say I feel great, valued, treated equally,
competent and successful?</p>

<p>Over the years, it was so subtle, but while men were promoted, I was
sidelined and told I didn&rsquo;t need additional leadership training. I
watched peers go to new heights while I perfected and elevated my
current role, but was never able to move beyond it because I was
perceived as indispensable in that role, but it also locked me in away
from management opportunities.</p>

<p>Aside from my boss, the people at work are great and supportive. I
just feel like I am not good enough of a programmer and I&rsquo;m bringing
down the view of &ldquo;women in tech.&rdquo; I know that&rsquo;s ridiculous and maybe
it&rsquo;s partially that it&rsquo;s a bad job with work that I have a bitch of a
time being excited about. [&hellip;] But the thing is, I genuinely enjoy
programming for myself, and enjoy the culture (aside from the nasty
stuff!) so I can&rsquo;t see myself ever leaving that.</p>

<p>Overall I&rsquo;ve had an overwhelmingly positive experience as a woman in
tech, and consider myself quite fortunate in that respect. I&rsquo;m working
in healthcare IT now, which has a great gender ratio and excellent
people and meaningful work.</p>

<p>The tech industry is a great place to be and one day women will feel
just as welcome as men to be in it. I hope I&rsquo;ll get to see that day
myself.</p>

<p>I realized recently that feeling &ldquo;lucky&rdquo; because I&rsquo;ve only been
sexually harassed by an executive once and denied access to a job once
(that I know of) is insane. It might be getting off easy, but a guy
would have sued. I would leave tech if I had any other skillset. I&rsquo;m
over the frat boy air hockey culture.</p>

<p>I genuinely had trouble thinking of women in tech I admired (aside
from the two bosses I&rsquo;ve had in the last 4 years, who are brilliant).
I also got quite bummed out when I got to the question about my
experiences and realised exactly how many boxes I could tick.</p>

<p>It wasn&rsquo;t an option, but I have considered declining a perk at work,
because I was afraid people would think it was a reward for a sexual
favor. I&rsquo;m always worried that people will think I get ahead, not
because my work is great (it is!), but because I use sex in some way.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m so tired of being the only technical woman in the room. I&rsquo;m tired
of being the only woman in the room and having it assumed that someone
brought their admin. I&rsquo;m tired of people talking to my husband (also a
software engineer) about technical things and trying to talk to me
about family (I&rsquo;m just as technical as he is, and we don&rsquo;t have kids).
I&rsquo;m tired of people asking when I&rsquo;m going to leave the field as if
it&rsquo;s a given. I&rsquo;m afraid that it is a given.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>These answers give me hope and also break my heart. I hope we can all
make our own organizations better, and make everyone feel more like</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I feel great, valued, treated equally, competent and successful?&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and less like</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m tired of people asking when I&rsquo;m going to leave the field as if
it&rsquo;s a given. I&rsquo;m afraid that it is a given.&ldquo;.</p>
