     <p>I recently wrote an post called
<a href="http://jvns.ca/blog/2014/05/28/anonymous-talk-submission-equals-amazing/">Anonymous review is amazing</a>,
talking about our experience with anonymous review at
<a href="http://bangbangcon.com/">!!Con</a> (it was excellent! I was surprised
and delighted!). There was a discussion on the PyCon organizers list
today about whether PyCon should do anonymous review, and I started
thinking about this a little more carefully.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m going to make a few assumptions up front: our goal as conference
organizers is to have</p>

<ul>
<li>a process that is as unbiased as possible</li>
<li>speakers who will be engaging</li>
<li>who come from diverse backgrounds</li>
<li>where some are new speakers, and some are more experienced</li>
</ul>

<p>Let&rsquo;s talk about whether anonymous review will help us with these things!</p>

<p></p>

<h2 id="is-anonymous-review-less-biased">Is anonymous review less biased?</h2>

<p><strong>Yes.</strong></p>

<p>Firstly, people <em>believe</em> that anonymous review is less biased.</p>

<p>One of our !!Con&rsquo;s speakers,
<a href="https://twitter.com/hypotext">Katherine Ye</a>, told us:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Thank you so much for [anonymizing everything]! It’s a relief to
know that I wasn’t picked for gender, race, age, or anything like
that.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/hoxworth">Kenneth Hoxworth</a> said of RailsConf&rsquo;s
anonymous review process:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It gave me courage that I wasn&rsquo;t going up against big names.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&rsquo;s really important for people to have confidence in a conference&rsquo;s
review process. Nobody wants to put time into a proposal if they&rsquo;re
going to be dismissed because of their gender or age or race, or just
because they&rsquo;re not famous enough. People also worry about not being
accepted on their own merit.</p>

<p>Anonymous review helps us build confidence, and that&rsquo;s really
valuable.</p>

<p>Anonymous review is also <strong>actually</strong> less biased.
<a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/mckinley/notes/blind.html">This study by Kathryn McKinley</a>
shows that, in peer-reviewed scientific articles, both men and women
express systemic bias against women, and double-blind reviewing
removed that bias. (thanks to
<a href="https://twitter.com/lindsey">Lindsey Kuper</a> for the link!)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>They found nepotism and gender bias were signiﬁcant factors in the
evaluation process. To be judged as good as their male counter
parts, female applicants had to be 2.5 times more productive.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="will-anonymous-review-help-my-conference-s-diversity">Will anonymous review help my conference&rsquo;s diversity?</h2>

<p><strong>Maybe.</strong> <a href="https://ep2014.europython.eu">EuroPython</a> has an anonymous
  review process, and recently very few of their announced speakers
  were women. This is because very few women applied to give talks.
  You can&rsquo;t accept talks that don&rsquo;t exist!</p>

<p>A more effective way to diversify your speaker pool is through active
outreach. I don&rsquo;t know of any evidence to show that anonymous review
helps you attract a more diverse range of speakers. (is there some? I
would love to know.)</p>

<h2 id="will-anonymous-review-help-me-get-inexperienced-speakers">Will anonymous review help me get inexperienced speakers?</h2>

<p><strong>Maybe</strong>.</p>

<p>On one hand, we have</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It gave me courage that I wasn&rsquo;t going up against big names.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>On the other hand, <a href="http://twitter.com/dougnap">Douglas Napoleone</a>
pointed out:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>An anonymous system has an inherent bias towards very well written
 proposals. Those people whom have given the most talks are those
 whom are best at writing proposals which are best at getting
 through selection committees. It becomes a feedback loop which cuts
 out the very speakers we want most. Knowing that a person is a new
 speaker with a decent proposal is key when comparing them against a
 proposal by someone whom has given a talk at the last 8 python
 conferences.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>PyCon&rsquo;s approach is to actively encourage new speakers to apply and
work with them to write better proposals, and that&rsquo;s been successful.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/skade">Florian Gilchner</a> wrote about eurucamp&rsquo;s
experience with anonymous review
<a href="https://gist.github.com/jvns/cf74079ecdded0dad502#comment-1240653">here</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We found that newcomers don&rsquo;t write worse proposals than seasoned
speakers. Quite the contrary, we found that many proposals that are
submitted to many conferences are unspecific and dull and would only
fly by having a big name attached. Anonymous CFPs are very good at
weeding out copy-pasta. We didn&rsquo;t accept quite a few people that
would have been really shiny on the program.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Every year, we have at least one person we take huge bets on and get
very good talks out of that. Most of the time, it&rsquo;s someone would
[would lose out] in a direct and open battle.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="but-will-my-speakers-be-good">But will my speakers be good?!</h2>

<p>This is probably the scariest part. We did anonymous review for !!Con,
and
<a href="http://jvns.ca/blog/2014/05/28/anonymous-talk-submission-equals-amazing/">our speakers were very good</a>.
Our main hope was that if somebody wrote a proposal about an
interesting topic, then they could give an engaging 10-minute talk.
This worked. It&rsquo;s relevant here that our talks were all lightning
talks.</p>

<p>We also had an anonymizer, who did an amazing job reviewing videos and
telling us his impressions. This meant that we had to trust his
judgement (which I do! and our speakers were great!), but having only
one person watching talks introduces bias.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d be worried about doing anonymous review if I was organizing a
conference where the talks were longer. (though it&rsquo;s been done
successfully!)</p>

<h2 id="so-should-you-do-anonymous-review">So should you do anonymous review?</h2>

<p>Anonymous review takes extra time. You should think about what
benefits you hope that it&rsquo;ll bring, and what your alternatives are.
There&rsquo;s some excellent discussion on the comments to
<a href="https://gist.github.com/jvns/cf74079ecdded0dad502">a draft of this post</a>.
Go read the whole thing.</p>

<p>Some other things you can spend time on:</p>

<ul>
<li>doing outreach to get more applications from under-represented
communities</li>
<li>giving new speakers feedback on their proposals and helping them do
a better job</li>
<li>writing up a really good call for speakers (see
<a href="http://2014.jsconf.eu/call-for-speakers/">JSConf EU&rsquo;s!</a>)</li>
<li>running brainstorming sessions to help people come up with ideas</li>
</ul>

<p>I would do it again for !!Con, since the response to it was super
positive and the talks were good. I find the bias-reduction argument
pretty compelling. Nepotism and accepting your friends&rsquo; talks are
really hard to fight against. Judging speaker quality still worries
me!</p>
