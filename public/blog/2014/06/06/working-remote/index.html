     <p>I&rsquo;ve been working remotely for <a href="http://stripe.com">Stripe</a> for 3
months now.</p>

<p>I decided to do this because I interviewed at this place, and the
people were thoughtful and friendly and interesting and knew things
that I did not know! But they were all in San Francisco, and I didn&rsquo;t
want to move there at all. They convinced me that if I worked remote
it might not be a disaster.</p>

<p></p>

<p>I was still pretty scared about working remote, though! So far it&rsquo;s
been hard, but I&rsquo;m learning how to do it better. I&rsquo;m somewhat
extroverted, so it&rsquo;s possible for me to go a bit stir-crazy sitting
alone by myself all day.</p>

<p>I live on the east coast. The people I work with are mostly in San
Francisco, three time zones away. So when I start work it&rsquo;s usually
around 6am in SF.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s start with some things I have trouble with:</p>

<h3 id="hard-things">Hard things</h3>

<ul>
<li>Timezones are hard. If I start working at 8, there aren&rsquo;t many
people I can talk to BECAUSE IT&rsquo;S 5AM. (however: it&rsquo;s a really good
time to focus! And I can be a wizard and finish tasks before
everyone wakes up in the morning!)</li>
<li>I don&rsquo;t know how to meet new people without visiting the physical
office. A lot of people are just names on IRC to me. I do not know
of any upside to this, or how to fix it.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m worried about the winter.</li>
<li>I didn&rsquo;t realize how much I depended on synchronous communication
(talking face-to-face!) to do things until it was taken away from
me. This is thankfully getting easier.</li>
<li>It seems pretty difficult for me to know very much about the office
culture.</li>
<li>I find building consensus about technical decisions hard to do
remotely. (see: depending on synchronous communication)</li>
<li>A/V is hard. I often don&rsquo;t try to participate in talks because I
don&rsquo;t expect the experience to be good.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="good-things">Good things:</h3>

<ul>
<li>I get to work with people who I like and live where I want to live.
And I&rsquo;m learning a lot. This is why I decided to do this in the
first place =)</li>
<li>I can work in my backyard in the sun.</li>
<li>I have more flexibility about when and where to work. I appreciate
this more than I thought I would.</li>
<li>Thinking about working remote as &ldquo;a cool possibility with some ups
and downs&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;this enemy that means I HAVE TO SEE LESS
PEOPLE OH NO&rdquo; helps me be happy instead of grumpy.</li>
<li>My happiness seems to be proportional to the amount of time I spend
talking to people. This is something I can measure and optimize!</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m getting better at asynchronous communication.</li>
<li>If I ask someone to do something when I finish work, they&rsquo;ll be
working for 3 hours after me! It might be already done when I start
the next day.</li>
<li>2 people on my team are remote!
(<a href="https://twitter.com/colinmarc">colin</a> and
<a href="https://twitter.com/avibryant">avi</a>). This is a huge deal. If I
were the only one it would probably be a disaster and I would be way
more sad. As far as I can tell Avi&rsquo;s been working remote
approximately forever and he has a lot of good things to say.</li>
<li>I like that Stripe actually changes things to accommodate remotes
(for instance: the all-hands meeting switched times so that it&rsquo;s not
at 7:30pm on Friday on the east coast)</li>
<li>Basically all of the discussion on my team happens over IRC/email.
This means that there is a lot of IRC to keep up with. This is
harder than I expected.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="strategies">Strategies</h3>

<ul>
<li>I changed my work computer&rsquo;s clock to be the time in San Francisco.
This helps more than I expected.</li>
<li>I made a short URL (<a href="http://go/julia">http://go/julia</a>) that links to a Google Hangout
with me</li>
<li>Deciding to be happy this summer. There is no reason to be sad in
the summer.</li>
<li>Talking to other people who work remote sometimes and learning about
things they do!</li>
</ul>

<p>That&rsquo;s all! Maybe there will be further updates.</p>
