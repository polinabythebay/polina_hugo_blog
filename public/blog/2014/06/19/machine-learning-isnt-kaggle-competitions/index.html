     <p>I write about strace and kernel programming on this blog, but at work
I actually mostly work on machine learning, and it&rsquo;s about time I
started writing about it! Disclaimer: I work on a data analysis /
engineering team at a tech company, so that&rsquo;s where I&rsquo;m coming from.</p>

<p>When I started trying to get better at machine learning, I went to
<a href="http://www.kaggle.com/">Kaggle</a> (a site where you compete to solve
machine learning problems) and tried out one of the classification
problems. I used an
out-of-the-box algorithm, messed around a bit, and definitely did not
make the leaderboard. I felt sad and demoralized &ndash; what if I
was really bad at this and never got to do math at work?! I still
don&rsquo;t think I could win a Kaggle competition. But I have a job where I do
(among other things) machine learning! What gives?</p>

<p>To back up from Kaggle for a second, let&rsquo;s imagine that you have an
awesome startup idea. You&rsquo;re going to predict flight arrival times for
people! There are a ton of decisions you&rsquo;ll need to make before you even
start thinking about support vector machines:</p>

<p></p>

<h3 id="understand-the-business-problem">Understand the business problem</h3>

<p>If you want to predict flight arrival times, what are you really
trying to do? Some possible options:</p>

<ul>
<li>Help the airline understand which flights are likely to be delayed, so
they can fix it.</li>
<li>Help people buy flights that are less likely to be delayed.</li>
<li>Warn people if their flight tomorrow is going to be delayed</li>
</ul>

<p>I&rsquo;ve spent time on projects where I didn&rsquo;t understand at all how the
model was going to fit into business plans. If this is you, it <em>doesn&rsquo;t
matter</em> how good your model is. At all.</p>

<p>Understanding the business problem will also help you decide:</p>

<ul>
<li>How accurate does my model really need to be? What kind of false
positive rate is acceptable?</li>
<li>What data can I use? If you&rsquo;re predicting flight days tomorrow, you
can look at weather data, but if someone is buying a flight a month
from now then you&rsquo;ll have no clue.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="choose-a-metric-to-optimize">Choose a metric to optimize</h3>

<p>Let&rsquo;s take our flight delays example. We first have to decide whether to
do classification (&ldquo;will this flight be delayed for at least an hour&rdquo;)
or regression (&ldquo;how long will this flight be delayed for?&rdquo;). Let&rsquo;s say
we pick regression.</p>

<p>People often optimize the sum of squares because it has nice statistical
properties. But mispredicting a flight arrival time by 10 hours and by
20 hours are pretty much equally bad. Is the sum of squares really
appropriate here?</p>

<h3 id="decide-what-data-to-use">Decide what data to use</h3>

<p>Let&rsquo;s say I already have the airline, the flight number, departure
airport, plane model, and the departure and arrival times.</p>

<p>Should I try to buy more specific information about the different plane
models (age, what parts are in them..)? Really accurate weather data?
The amount of information available to you isn&rsquo;t fixed! You can get
more!</p>

<h3 id="clean-up-your-data">Clean up your data</h3>

<p>Once you have data, your data will be a mess. In this flight search
example, there will likely be</p>

<ul>
<li>airports that are inconsistently named</li>
<li>missing delay information all over the place</li>
<li>weird date formats</li>
<li>trouble reconciling weather data and airport location</li>
</ul>

<p>Cleaning up data to the point where you can work with it is a
huge amount of work. If you&rsquo;re trying to reconcile a lot of sources of
data that you don&rsquo;t control like in this flight search example, it can
take 80% of your time.</p>

<h3 id="build-a-model">Build a model!</h3>

<p>This is the fun Kaggle part. Training! Cross-validation! Yay!</p>

<p>Now that we&rsquo;ve built what we think is a great model, we actually have to
use it:</p>

<h3 id="put-your-model-into-production">Put your model into production</h3>

<p>Netflix didn&rsquo;t actually implement the model that
won the Netflix competition because
<a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/ryanholiday/2012/04/16/what-the-failed-1m-netflix-prize-tells-us-about-business-advice/">it was too complicated</a>.</p>

<p>If you trained your model in Python, can you run it in production in
Python? How fast does it need to be able to return results? Are you
running a model that bids on advertising spots / does high frequency
trading?</p>

<p>If we&rsquo;re predicting flight delays, it&rsquo;s probably okay for our model to
run somewhat slowly.</p>

<p>Another surprisingly difficult thing is gathering the data to evaluate
your model &ndash; getting historical weather data is one thing, but getting
that same data in real time to predict flight delays <em>right now</em> is
totally different.</p>

<h3 id="measure-your-model-s-performance">Measure your model&rsquo;s performance</h3>

<p>Now that we&rsquo;re running the model on live data, how do I measure its
real-life performance? Where do I log the scores it&rsquo;s producing? If
there&rsquo;s a huge change in the inputs my model is getting after 6 months,
how will I find out?</p>

<h3 id="kaggle-solves-all-of-this-for-you">Kaggle solves all of this for you.</h3>

<p>With Kaggle, almost all of these problems are already solved for you:
you don&rsquo;t need to worry about the engineering aspects of running a
model on live data, the underlying business problem, choosing a metric,
or collecting and cleaning up data.</p>

<p>You won&rsquo;t go through all these steps just once &ndash; maybe you&rsquo;ll build a
model and it won&rsquo;t perform well so you&rsquo;ll try to add some additional
features and see if you can build a better model. Or maybe how useful
the model is to your business depends on how good the results are.</p>

<p>Doing Kaggle problems is fun! It means you can focus on machine
learning algorithm nerdery and get better at that. But it&rsquo;s pretty far
removed from my job, where I work on a
<a href="https://stripe.com/jobs#data_engineer">team (hiring!)</a> that thinks
about all of these problems. Right now I&rsquo;m looking at measuring
models&rsquo; performance once they&rsquo;re in production, for instance!</p>

<p>So if you look at Kaggle leaderboards and think that you&rsquo;re bad at
machine learning because you&rsquo;re not doing well, don&rsquo;t. It&rsquo;s a fun but
artificial problem that doesn&rsquo;t reflect real machine learning work.</p>

<p>(to be clear: I don&rsquo;t think that Kaggle misrepresents itself, or does
a bad job &ndash; it specializes in a particular thing and that&rsquo;s fine. But
when I was starting out, I thought that machine learning work would be
like Kaggle competitions, and it&rsquo;s not.)</p>
