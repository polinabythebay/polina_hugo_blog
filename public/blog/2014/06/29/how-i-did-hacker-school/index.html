     <p><a href="https://www.hackerschool.com/">Hacker School</a> is a 12 week workshop
where you work on becoming a better programmer. But when you have 12
weeks of uninterrupted time to spend on whatever you want, what do you
actually do? I
<a href="http://jvns.ca/blog/categories/hackerschool/">wrote down what I worked on every day of Hacker School</a>,
but I always have trouble articulating advice about what to work on.
So this isn&rsquo;t advice, it&rsquo;s what I did.</p>

<p></p>

<p>One huge part of the way I ended up approaching Hacker School was to
ignore a ton of stuff that goes on there. For example! I find all
these things kind of interesting:</p>

<ul>
<li>machine learning</li>
<li>web development</li>
<li>hardware projects</li>
<li>games</li>
<li>new programming languages</li>
</ul>

<p>But I&rsquo;d been working as a web developer / in machine learning for a
couple of years, and I wasn&rsquo;t scared by them. I don&rsquo;t feel right now
like learning more programming languages is going to make me a better
programmer.</p>

<p>And there were <em>tons</em> of interesting-sounding workshops where Mary
would live code a space invaders game in Javascript (!!!), or Zach
would give an intermediate Clojure workshop, or people would work
together on a fun hardware project. People were building neural
networks, which looked fun!</p>

<p>I mostly did not go to these workshops. It turned out that I was
interested in all those things, but more interested in learning:</p>

<ul>
<li>systems programming
(<a href="http://jvns.ca/blog/2013/12/10/day-40-learning-about-linkers/">linkers</a>!
<a href="http://jvns.ca/blog/2014/04/20/debug-your-programs-like-theyre-closed-source/">strace</a>!)</li>
<li>networking
(<a href="http://jvns.ca/blog/2013/10/29/day-18-in-ur-connection/">ARP</a>!,
<a href="http://jvns.ca/blog/2013/11/27/day-34b-wrapping-up-the-tcp-stack/">writing a TCP stack!</a>)</li>
<li>how to write an operating system
(<a href="http://jvns.ca/blog/2013/12/16/day-43-hopefully-the-last-day-spent-fixing-linker-problems/">why is my operating system being erased?!</a>)</li>
<li>security (what actually is a buffer overflow?
<a href="http://jvns.ca/blog/2013/10/28/day-17-buffer-overflows/">how do I make one?</a>)</li>
<li><a href="http://jvns.ca/blog/2013/10/24/day-16-gzip-plus-poetry-equals-awesome/">how gzip works</a></li>
<li>how to write a
<a href="http://jvns.ca/blog/2013/10/01/hacker-school-day-2-what-does-a-shell-even-do/">shell</a></li>
<li>how floating point numbers work! Stefan Karpinski gave an amazing
talk about this.</li>
</ul>

<p>I wanted to work on things that seemed impossible to me, and writing an
operating system seemed impossible. I didn&rsquo;t know <em>anything</em> about
operating systems. This was amazing.</p>

<p>This meant sometimes saying no to requests to pair on things that
weren&rsquo;t on my roadmap, even if they seemed super interesting! I also
learned that if I wanted something to exist, I could <em>just make it</em>.</p>

<p>I ran a kernel development workshop for a while in my first two weeks.
<a href="https://github.com/jtakkala">Jari</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/pyb">Pierre</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/briandignan">Brian</a> came, and they answered &ldquo;what
is a kernel? what are its responsibilities?&ldquo;. This was hugely helpful
to me, and I learned a ton of the basics of kernel programming. Nobody
I talked to had built an operating system from scratch, so I learned
how! <a href="https://filippo.io/">Filippo</a> answered a lot of my security
questions and helped when I was confused about assembly.
<a href="https://twitter.com/lifeissweetgood">Daphne</a> was working on a shell
and I paired with her and learned a ton.</p>

<p>People at Hacker School know an <em>amazing</em> amount of stuff. There is so
much to learn from them.</p>

<p>So I don&rsquo;t have advice, but for me one some the most important things
to remember about Hacker School were that <em>other people have different
interests than me, and that&rsquo;s okay</em>, and <em>I can make Hacker School
what I want it to be</em>.</p>
