     <p>There are all kinds of things that I think I &ldquo;should&rdquo; know and don&rsquo;t.
A few things that I don&rsquo;t understand as well as I&rsquo;d like to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Database replication and sharding (seriously how does replication
even work)</li>
<li>How fast a computer can process data (should I expect more or less
than 6GB/s if it&rsquo;s a simple CPU-bound program where the data is
already in RAM?)</li>
<li>How do system calls work, reeeeally? (I do not understand context
switching nearly as well as I could!)</li>
<li>An truly embarrassing amount of basic statistics, even though I have
a math degree.</li>
</ul>

<p>There are lots of much more embarrassing things that I just can&rsquo;t
think of right now.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve started trying to ask questions any time I don&rsquo;t understand
something, instead of worrying about whether people will think I&rsquo;m
dumb for not knowing it. This is <em>magical</em>, because it means I can
then learn those things!</p>

<p></p>

<p>One of my very favorite examples of this is how I started learning
about operating systems. At the beginning of Hacker School, I realized
that I legitimately did not know what a kernel was or did more than
&ldquo;er, operating system stuff&rdquo;.</p>

<p>This was super embarrassing! I&rsquo;d been using Linux for 10 years, and I
didn&rsquo;t really understand at all what the basic responsibilities of the
Linux kernel were. Oh no! Instead of hiding under a rock, I <em>asked</em>.
And then people told me, and I wrote
<a href="http://jvns.ca/blog/2013/10/02/day-3-what-does-the-linux-kernel-even-do/">What does the Linux kernel even do?</a>.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know how I would have learned without asking. Now I have given
talks about getting started with understanding the Linux kernel! So
fun!</p>

<p>One surprising thing about asking questions is that when I start
digging into a problem, people who I respect and who know a lot will
sometimes not know the answers at all! For instance, I&rsquo;ll think that
someone totally knows about the Linux kernel, but of course they don&rsquo;t
know everything, and if I&rsquo;m trying to do something specific like write
a rootkit they might not know all the details of how to do it.</p>

<p><a href="http://aphyr.com/">aphyr</a> is a really good example of someone who
asks basic questions and gets unexpected answers. He does research
into whether distributed systems are reliable (linearizable?
consistent? / available?). The results he finds are like
<a href="http://aphyr.com/posts/315-call-me-maybe-rabbitmq">RabbitMQ might lose 40% of your data</a>.
Ooooops. If you don&rsquo;t start asking questions about how RabbitMQ works
from the beginning (in his case, by writing a program called Jepsen
that automates this kind of reliability testing), then you&rsquo;ll never
find that out. (be skeptical! Don&rsquo;t believe what people say even if
they&rsquo;re using fancy words!)</p>

<h2 id="i-don-t-understand">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand.&rdquo;</h2>

<p>Another hard thing is admitting that I don&rsquo;t understand. I try to not
be too judgemental about this &ndash; if someone is explaining something to
me and it doesn&rsquo;t make sense, it&rsquo;s possible that they&rsquo;re explaining it
badly! Or that I&rsquo;m tired! Or any other number of reasons. But if I
don&rsquo;t <em>tell</em> them I&rsquo;m don&rsquo;t understand, I&rsquo;m never going to understand
the damn thing.</p>

<p>So I try to take a deep breath and say cheerfully &ldquo;Nope!&rdquo;, figure
exactly which aspect of the thing I don&rsquo;t understand, and ask a
clarifying question.</p>

<p>As a side effect, when I go to a talk about a subject I&rsquo;m interested in, and I
don&rsquo;t understand something, I&rsquo;m a lot more willing to ask questions like &ldquo;so
what IS &lt;basic concept that wasn&rsquo;t explained&gt;?&ldquo;. Usually people are
really happy to answer!</p>

<h2 id="avoiding-mansplaining">Avoiding mansplaining</h2>

<p>A difficult thing about asking questions is that I have to be pretty
careful about asking the <em>right</em> questions and making it clear which
parts I know already. This is just good hygiene, and makes sure
nobody&rsquo;s time gets wasted.</p>

<p>For instance, I have sometimes said things like &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know anything
about statistics&rdquo;, which is actually false and sometimes results in
people trying to explain basic probability theory to me, or what an
estimator is, or maybe the difference between a biased and unbiased
estimator. It turns out these are actually things I know! So I need to
be more specific, like &ldquo;can we walk through some basic survival
analysis?&rdquo; (actually a thing I would like to understand!)</p>

<h2 id="huge-success">HUGE SUCCESS</h2>

<p>So! Understanding and learning are more important than feeling smart.
Probably the most important thing I learned at Hacker School was how
to ask questions and admit when I don&rsquo;t understand something. I know
way more things now as a result! (see: this entire blog of things I
have learned)</p>
