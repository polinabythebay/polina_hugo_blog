<p>I gave a talk this weekend about debugging tools I love (here are <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/jvns/systems-programming-is-for-everyone">the slides</a>, such as they are). I think of these tools like a swiss army knife &ndash; if something on your system is wrong or slow, in any programming language, knowing how to use them can really help you out. I&rsquo;ve written pretty extensively on this, but I didn&rsquo;t have a central list to refer to. So! Here&rsquo;s the list of my current favorite tools. There are only 5! I&rsquo;ve used all of them (except opensnoop) to debug actual problems.</p>

<p>tcpdump and wireshark and opensnoop are also things that you can have on OS X.</p>

<h3 id="strace">strace</h3>

<p>A tool that traces system calls. My favorite thing. I have a bunch of posts with examples of how to use it on this blog. If you want to read what I think of it you should read the fanzine reference that you can read <a href="/blog/2015/04/15/strace-zine/">here</a>.</p>

<p>strace is pretty broadly useful, but keep in mind it can really slow down your programs.</p>

<p>I would be remiss if I did not mention the even-more-awesome dtrace. Colin Jones has a <a href="https://blog.8thlight.com/colin-jones/archive.html">nice introduction</a>.</p>

<h3 id="dstat">dstat</h3>

<p>A really simple tool that prints out how much data got sent over the network / written to disk every second. This is great when you suspect something is going on with network/disk usage and want to see what&rsquo;s happening in real time.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s also iostat and netstat and atop and a bunch of other tools, but dstat is my favorite.</p>

<h3 id="tcpdump-wireshark">tcpdump + wireshark</h3>

<p>For spying on network traffic. I wrote an introduction explaining how to use them in <a href="/blog/2016/03/17/tcpdump-is-amazing/">tcpdump is amazing</a>.</p>

<p>When using these, it really helps to have a basic understanding of how networking works. Luckily the basics (&ldquo;what&rsquo;s the difference between IP and TCP and HTTP? what&rsquo;s a network packet?&rdquo;) are totally possible to pick up :D.</p>

<h3 id="perf">perf</h3>

<p>Have a C program and want to know which functions it&rsquo;s spending the most time in? <code>perf</code> is a sampling profiler for Linux that can tell you that.</p>

<p><code>perf top</code> gives you a live view of which functions are running right now, just like <code>top</code>. I like to use <code>perf top</code> no matter what language my programs are written in, just to see if I can understand anything from it. Sometimes it works!</p>

<p>node.js has built-in support for using perf to show you which Node function is running right now. You can also get this for JVM programs with perf-map-agent.</p>

<p>Brendan Gregg&rsquo;s website has the best <a href="http://www.brendangregg.com/perf.html">introduction to perf</a> I know.</p>

<p>You can use perf to generate amazing <a href="http://www.brendangregg.com/flamegraphs.html">flame graphs</a> like this:</p>

<h3 id="opensnoop">opensnoop</h3>

<p>Opensnoop is a new script that you can get as of Ubuntu 16.04. It&rsquo;s a delightfully simple tool &ndash; it just shows you which files are being opened right now on your computer. And it&rsquo;s fast, unlike strace!</p>

<p>opensnoop also exists on OS X and does basically the same thing.</p>

<p>Go to the <a href="https://github.com/iovisor/bcc">iovisor/bcc</a> repo on github for installation instructions. It works using eBPF, which is a new thing that I will not explain yet here but Brendan Gregg has been writing about enthusiastically for some time. You don&rsquo;t need to know how it works to use it, though :).</p>
