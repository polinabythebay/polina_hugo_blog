<p>Someone wrote me an email today asking me for advice for tech bloggers. I don&rsquo;t
give advice, but then they went on to ask me a bunch of specific questions. So here are some answers to those questions! And a couple more that they didn&rsquo;t ask.</p>

<h3 id="what-were-you-hoping-to-get-out-of-your-writing-and-did-it-work">What were you hoping to get out of your writing, and did it work?</h3>

<p>I think different people have different motivations for blogging. These are mine!</p>

<p>When I started at the Recurse Center, I jokingly referred to blogging as my &ldquo;media strategy&rdquo; to help me find a cool job afterwards. This was a joke but also&hellip; not totally a joke! I really did want to find a more interesting job than the one I&rsquo;d had before, and writing a blog seemed like a reasonable way to make progress on that. A lot of the people who interviewed me mentioned my blog as a reason they&rsquo;d heard of me, so I guess this worked. I have a way better job now than I did before.</p>

<p>Now that I&rsquo;m gainfully employed, I mostly blog to</p>

<ul>
<li>learn new things! Firstly, writing things down helps me clarify the ideas for myself. But also sometimes I&rsquo;ll write about <a href="http://jvns.ca/blog/2016/04/23/java-garbage-collection-can-be-really-slow/">java garbage collection</a> and then people will reply to it with an <a href="http://jvns.ca/blog/2016/04/23/some-links-on-java-garbage-collection/">avalanche of links</a> and extra information</li>
<li>tell people things that I wish I knew a year ago!</li>
<li>very occasionally talk about my opinions and try to make the tech world slightly more like the place I would like it to be (like <a href="http://jvns.ca/blog/2014/06/14/asking-questions-is-a-superpower/">asking questions is a superpower</a>)</li>
<li>meet interesting people</li>
</ul>

<p>These are all more or less successful, and I learn enough things directly because I blog that it&rsquo;s totally worth it. I also have gotten to meet a lot of great people because of writing this blog. WIN.</p>

<h3 id="how-did-you-start-writing">How did you start writing?</h3>

<p>I started by writing every day at when at the <a href="https://recurse.com">Recurse Center</a>. I spent maybe.. 2 hours writing per day? And I wrote a lot of things that are not super interesting to future-julia like <a href="http://jvns.ca/blog/2013/10/09/day-7-an-echo-server-in-clojure/">this one</a> and <a href="http://jvns.ca/blog/2013/11/18/day-29-trying-out-emacs/">this one</a>.</p>

<p>I think writing every day was a good discipline and the sheer volume helped me write some interesting things. Now I write less often: once every week or two.</p>

<p>I used to really wonder how <a href="http://mathbabe.org/">Cathy O&rsquo;Neil</a> consistently wrote so many interesting posts but now I think it&rsquo;s because she thinks about the stuff she&rsquo;s interested in a lot and then regularly writes down whatever she&rsquo;s thinking about right now.</p>

<h3 id="how-long-does-it-take-you-to-write-a-post">How long does it take you to write a post?</h3>

<p>1-3 hours probably. I sit down and write something and don&rsquo;t stop until I&rsquo;ve published it. I know other people who edit their work and write more Serious Long Form Things that they try to really polish and it&rsquo;s awesome. I rarely do that.</p>

<p>I really like writing short blog posts because I have a short attention span and I find short blog posts easier to digest when other people write them. And they&rsquo;re less of an investment! Half of my blog posts are less than 500 words, and, looking at them, I&rsquo;ve gotten a ton of positive comments on a lot of those under-500-words posts. And sometimes I write a thing and nobody really seems to like it and that is also okay.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a great talk called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_F9jxsfGCw">How I Won The Lottery</a> by Darius Kazemi about creative work and how producing things that you think are good is like buying a lottery ticket. So I guess I try to make good things and buy many small lottery tickets.</p>

<p>Also some things take me more write, though. I spent extra time on <a href="http://jvns.ca/blog/2015/12/30/do-the-math-on-your-stock-options/">Things you should know about stock options before negotiating an offer</a> and <a href="https://codewords.recurse.com/issues/five/why-do-neural-networks-think-a-panda-is-a-vulture">How to trick a neural network into thinking a panda is a vulture</a> took a bunch of extra research.</p>

<h3 id="how-do-you-decide-what-s-worth-writing-about">How do you decide what&rsquo;s worth writing about?</h3>

<ul>
<li>&ldquo;would this have helped me a year ago?&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;would this have helped me last week?&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;do i think this would be interesting to at least like 2 other people?&rdquo;</li>
</ul>

<p>Sometimes I&rsquo;ll ask one friend and if they think the idea is interesting, then, I&rsquo;m good to go!</p>

<p>I know lots of people who are AMAZING and have AMAZING THINGS TO SAY and I often need to harangue them for a while before they remember that not everybody already knows those amazing things (&ldquo;oh, people are interested in that??? I never would have thought!&rdquo;). Sometimes I&rsquo;m even successful!</p>

<p>Basically I have a pretty low bar for interestingness and it mostly works out fine.</p>

<h3 id="how-do-you-find-the-balance-between-getting-things-done-and-writing-about-your-work">How do you find the balance between getting things done and writing about your work?</h3>

<p>When I do side projects, I&rsquo;m often a lot less motivated to do them if I <em>don&rsquo;t</em>
write about them &ndash; if I do the project on my own, then I learn from it, but if
I do it and write about it then EVERYONE can learn from it!!!</p>

<h3 id="is-it-scary-to-admit-things-that-you-don-t-know">Is it scary to admit things that you don&rsquo;t know?</h3>

<p>In practically every post I write, I say &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know $thing!&rdquo;. This is different from other blogs where the authors talk about things they know about or are experts on.</p>

<p>On one hand, saying that I don&rsquo;t know things this means people are less likely to think I am a magical wizard who knows everything. On the other hand, nobody ever thought I was a magical wizard who knows everything in the first place.</p>

<p>I used to never want to write about machine learning because it was my JOB and I&rsquo;m supposed to know EVERYTHING about my job and what if I write about machine learning and people discover that I don&rsquo;t know everything about the field.</p>

<p>Mostly I found this fear got in the way of me learning things and getting better at my job. Telling people what I don&rsquo;t know means that they can help me learn it sooner!</p>

<p>On the balance I think I&rsquo;d happy be known for being curious and knowledgeable and a good source of information &amp; questions and that I don&rsquo;t need to be a magical wizard oracle. It&rsquo;s still sorta scary sometimes, but it&rsquo;s the bet I&rsquo;ve made and so I&rsquo;m sticking with it for now :)</p>

<h3 id="are-people-jerks-on-the-internet">Are people jerks on the internet?</h3>

<p>Nobody asked me this but I will answer it anyway. I hear a lot from people that they&rsquo;re worried about blogging because they think that the internet will just be mean to them.</p>

<p>I maintain a pretty aggressively positive tone in my blogging. This is partly because it&rsquo;s genuinely how I view a lot of things, but it&rsquo;s also partly a defensive tactic. Getting negative comments is stressful and if I&rsquo;m super positive all the time (which is pretty easy!) then I think it attracts less internet jerks. Mostly people are not jerks to me.</p>

<p>BUT. This is mostly to say &ndash; please don&rsquo;t be unnecessarily mean about people&rsquo;s work on the internet! My friend wrote an awesome post the other day and then people made all these jerk comments and it sucked. I &lt;3 criticism (&ldquo;hey that thing you said is incorrect in an <a href="https://www.recurse.com/manual#no-well-actuallys">important way</a>!&ldquo;) and &lt;/3 people being jerks (&ldquo;lol are u dumb that is not how the kernel works&rdquo;).</p>

<h3 id="blogging">❤ blogging</h3>

<p>Writing this blog has been super helpful for me professionally and I really like it. It takes a lot of time (apparently I&rsquo;ve written 200 blog posts now???), but the cool thing is that once I&rsquo;ve written those 200 blog posts they&rsquo;re there forever! People can just keep reading them and maybe learning interesting things!</p>

<p>I also think it&rsquo;s extremely fun and interesting when regular people (not Programming Wizards) just write about their regular work and what they&rsquo;re learning right now or what they wish they&rsquo;d known in the past.</p>
