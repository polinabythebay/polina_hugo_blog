<p>I just switched this blog from Jekyll to <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a>! This is a very small thing but maybe you
will find it interesting if you find microoptimizing the way you generate your website
interesting (like I do, apparently).</p>

<p>problem: Jekyll generated my site slowly. It took, like, 10 seconds! Who has time to wait
for that! Seriously. My friends keep telling me that Hugo is really cool and it&rsquo;s in Go
and it will make my site generate in 0 seconds. So I decided to give it an hour and see
how far I&rsquo;d get. I got like 80% there in an hour, and it only took 4 more hours to finish
the remaining 20%. Not too bad!</p>

<p>Also I got to delete a bunch of cruft in my website that I didn&rsquo;t understand. Now I never
need to learn to understand it!</p>

<p>My overall review of Hugo: Jekyll was fine. Hugo is also fine. I only ran into one weird
bug when working with it today which is pretty good. Hugo is faster, which I like, and it
means I don&rsquo;t need to have a working Ruby dev environment. I couldn&rsquo;t edit my site once
for six months because I was too frustrated to get Ruby to work again. So maybe Hugo is a
little more fine than Jekyll (which I pretty happily used for 4 years).</p>

<h3 id="julia-s-plan-for-migrating-to-hugo">julia&rsquo;s plan for migrating to Hugo</h3>

<p>There is a guide on the Hugo website <a href="https://gohugo.io/tutorials/migrate-from-jekyll/">explaining how to migrate</a>. I did not use this plan. The plan involves migrating Jekyll plugins to Hugo plugins, and who even knows how their Jekyll plugins work? Not me!</p>

<p><strong>step 1</strong>: run <code>hugo import jekyll</code></p>

<p>This gave me a Hugo site with all my content in it, but no theme. Not bad!</p>

<p><strong>step 2</strong>: import a random minimal theme</p>

<p>ok, now I can look at my blog posts! They have all the right words in them and are not obviously completely broken. Cool.</p>

<p><strong>step 3</strong>: put my theme back</p>

<p>I was terrified of this step. I am awful at HTML and CSS and I do not know how
my Jekyll theme works. So instead of trying to reproduce my theme, instead I went to
<a href="http://jvns.ca">http://jvns.ca</a>, and literally just copied the HTML there into Hugo theme files. Once my
site looked right (20 minutes later!) I then figured out what I needed to do
to generalize it so that not every page had the same title.</p>

<p>Working backwards from the HTML that Jekyll had generated to come up with a new working
theme was way faster than trying to understand what my Jekyll theme files were doing.</p>

<p><strong>step 4</strong>: fix everything else that was broken</p>

<p>this included:</p>

<ul>
<li>no RSS feed (along the way I found out that the amazing
<a href="https://twitter.com/antifuchs">Andreas</a> had posted a workaround for MY
EXACT RSS PROBLEM AT <a href="https://github.com/spf13/hugo/issues/1740">https://github.com/spf13/hugo/issues/1740</a>.</li>
<li>all my category pages were broken</li>
<li>I needed to rebuild my index page from scratch</li>
</ul>

<p>none of this stuff was actually that hard. Yay! Hugo seems pretty heavily influenced by
Jekyll so the porting was easy.</p>

<h3 id="the-hard-parts-of-static-site-generation">the hard parts of static site generation</h3>

<p>from hardest to easiest:</p>

<ol>
<li>writing posts</li>
<li>writing HTML/CSS so that they don&rsquo;t look terrible (I paid my amazing friend <a href="http://instamatique.com/blog/">Lea</a> to design my site for me. I do not know how to do this at all). But it gets an easier rating because it only had to happen once.</li>
<li>getting my static site generator to work</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="success">success</h3>

<p>now my site gets generated by Hugo in 0.4 seconds and I understand better how it&rsquo;s put
together from scratch. And now I don&rsquo;t rely on a mystery Jekyll category plugin that I
never understood in the first place. Yay! Some of my CSS is slightly more broken but I&rsquo;m
sure I&rsquo;ll be able to figure out how to fix it.</p>

<p>You can see the source for this website <a href="https://github.com/jvns/jvns.ca">on github</a> if
you want.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s also a <a href="https://github.com/jvns/jvns.ca/blob/master/Rakefile">Rakefile</a> I use to
generate it. It is pretty small. The most interesting thing is a <code>new_post</code> task which
creates a new post file for me. I stole it from Octopress and modified it pretty heavily
to do the Right Thing for me.</p>
