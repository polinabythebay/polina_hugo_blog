<p>I started reading &ldquo;<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Effective-DevOps-Building-Collaboration-Affinity/dp/1491926309">Effective DevOps</a>&rdquo; by <a href="https://twitter.com/sigje">Jennifer Davis</a> and
<a href="https://twitter.com/beerops">Katherine Daniels</a> yesterday.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m still only part of the way through, but I realized while reading it
that I had no idea what &ldquo;devops&rdquo; even meant. I had some vague idea that
it meant &ldquo;running programs, administrating servers, using chef and
puppet, I don&rsquo;t know&rdquo;.</p>

<p>I think the term &ldquo;devops&rdquo; is kind of contentious and I don&rsquo;t really care
to get into discussions about what words do or do not mean. BUT. What is
described as &ldquo;devops&rdquo; and &ldquo;the devops movement&rdquo; in Effective DevOps is
an extremely positive thing that I am excited about! So let&rsquo;s talk about
what this very positive thing is, and while we talk about it we will
call it devops.</p>

<h3 id="what-isn-t-devops">what isn&rsquo;t devops?</h3>

<p>One of the first things they clear up is what they <em>don&rsquo;t</em> mean by
devops.</p>

<p><strong>Not a job title, not an organization</strong></p>

<p>Of course devops <strong>is</strong> a job title that people use &ndash; someone emailed
me just today asking if I was interested as a job as a &ldquo;devops
engineer&rdquo;. And that does mean something, but it&rsquo;s not what we&rsquo;re talking
about right now.</p>

<p>I enjoyed reading <a href="http://www.networkworld.com/article/2886672/software/how-etsy-makes-devops-work.html">this article about devops at Etsy</a>.
One of the really key things about this article is &ndash; there is no devops
organization at Etsy. It&rsquo;s about how developers and operations people
work productively together! Also, it was a slow incremental migration
towards different practices. They did not wake up one day and become
devops. I think this is the <a href="https://youtu.be/LdOe18KhtT4">first talk that used the term &lsquo;devops&rsquo;</a>?</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s also not about &ldquo;everyone is a software developer&rdquo; &ndash; one of the authors of
this book, Katherine Daniels, is a <a href="https://beero.ps/2015/09/26/on-becoming-a-senior-engineer/">senior operations engineer at Etsy</a>.
I don&rsquo;t know any of the details of her job, but my impression is that she has a
lot of expertise in operations. It&rsquo;s not like &ldquo;make operations so
easy that nobody has to an expert at it&rdquo;. Of course you need people who
know a ton about operations! Probably those people write software as
part of their job?</p>

<p><strong>not just automation</strong></p>

<p>There have a been a bunch of super positive changes around reducing
automation when administering systems. puppet/chef! soon, terraform! AWS
autoscaling groups! But that is not devops. devops is about how people
work together.</p>

<h3 id="a-definition-sort-of">a definition, sort of</h3>

<p>I looked up devops on wikipedia and got this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In traditional functionally separated organizations there is rarely
cross-departmental integration of these functions with IT operations.
devops promotes a set of processes and methods for thinking about
communication and collaboration between development, QA, and IT
operations.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Okay, this is interesting! devops is about &ldquo;communication and
collaboration&rdquo;. That is really different from &ldquo;chef and puppet and
continuous integration and stuff&rdquo; &ndash; Puppet is software, communication
is about how humans work together.</p>

<p>Near the beginning of the book, Davis and Daniels describe some of their
respective experiences being the only person on-call and in charge of
keeping some software running. They then, over the course of the book,
talk through a bunch of case studies of organizations moving towards
more sustainable practice.</p>

<p>This really helped me understand where the book was coming from! I have
never worked at an organization with an &ldquo;operations team&rdquo; where
development and operations were separated into different organizations.</p>

<p>So devops is about people who with different strengths effectively
collaborating to build awesome software that runs reliably. That is a
thing I like!</p>

<h3 id="ideas-practices-that-are-part-of-devops">ideas &amp; practices that are part of devops</h3>

<ul>
<li>you should integrate development and operations together (or: you
should stop breaking dev and ops apart (thanks tef))</li>
<li>operations experts should have a hand in leading <strong>systems design and
architecture</strong>, not just be handed finished systems to run</li>
<li>when things go wrong, run blameless postmortems</li>
<li><strong>continuous integration</strong>. I also learned from this book what
continuous integration was! It is when you merge your changes into a
mainline branch very frequently instead of going off and building a
feature for weeks!</li>
<li>configuration management and automation tools like chef/puppet (&ldquo;no
snowflake servers&rdquo;)</li>
</ul>

<p>There are a lot more things, those are just 5.</p>

<p>Most of these things are about processes and people, not about technology.</p>

<p>Another pretty important thing here seems to be the
<a href="https://www.devopsdays.org/">devopsdays</a> conferences &ndash; it&rsquo;s really
cool that there&rsquo;s a series of local conferences that talk about how to
operate reliable software and bring people with different kinds of
expertise to talk. I haven&rsquo;t been to any of them yet, but bringing
people from different companies together to talk seems to be an
important part of the &ldquo;devops movement&rdquo;.</p>

<h3 id="assumptions-are-important">assumptions are important</h3>

<p>One of my favorite things about this book is that it makes a lot of my
assumptions explicit! Etsy influenced a lot of devops ideas, and where I
work now is influenced by Etsy, so a lot of this stuff is implicitly
familiar to me. But I hadn&rsquo;t thought of them as choices!</p>

<p>When I learned what &ldquo;continuous integration&rdquo; was (merging your changes
into master after working on them for 1-2 days instead of waiting weeks)
I was like &ldquo;uh, wait, what else would you do?&rdquo;. A lot of the stuff in
this book was like that &ndash; I hadn&rsquo;t realized that this was a choice my
organization was making, I thought that was just how things were!</p>

<p>But of course any organizational choice (like continuous integration,
blameless postmortems, having a separate operations team) <strong>is</strong> a
choice, and it&rsquo;s useful to understand why you&rsquo;re making it. Because
maybe there are even more improvements you can make over time!</p>

<h3 id="what-s-the-difference-between-devops-and-sre">what&rsquo;s the difference between devops and SRE?</h3>

<p>This <a href="http://blog.catchpoint.com/2016/09/01/oreilly-media-devops-vs-sre/">transcript of a panel discussion on devops vs SRE is good</a>.</p>

<h3 id="why-devops-is-exciting-evolution">why devops is exciting (&amp; evolution)</h3>

<p>I think I didn&rsquo;t realize it was exciting because I hadn&rsquo;t really
internalized that you could totally separate development and
operations. Right now the team I work on has maybe more operational
responsibilities than some other teams, but they&rsquo;ve never been separate.</p>

<p>But thinking of this as a <strong>choice</strong> where you recognize how important
operational expertise is, train developers to be better at operations,
make sure that operational concerns get seen at early stages of the
development process &ndash; that is super exciting to me! And this book
&ldquo;effective devops&rdquo; has a lot of ideas that I use already all the time,
but it also has ideas that I haven&rsquo;t thought of before!</p>

<p>And it makes me want to make my organization even better at it than it
already is, because even if we ostensibly practice &ldquo;devops&rdquo; and do
continuous integration and use jenkins and deploy 100 times a day or
whatever, that doesn&rsquo;t actually mean that we&rsquo;re the best and awesome and
that we can stop. That is never true! There is always more work to do to
make a more awesome organization.</p>

<p>And devops seems to be less about a &ldquo;manifesto&rdquo; (like the extreme
programming manifesto) and more of a large and fuzzy set of practices
that we&rsquo;re all learning together as an industry over time. That we can
constantly improve! And that is okay.</p>
