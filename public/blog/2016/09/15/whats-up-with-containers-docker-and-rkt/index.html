<p>Hello! I have been thinking about containers at work. I&rsquo;m going to talk about
running containers in production! I&rsquo;ve talked before about how
<a href="http://jvns.ca/blog/2015/11/09/docker-is-amazing/">using Docker for development is great</a>,
but that&rsquo;s not what this post is about. Using docker in development seems really great and fine and I have no problems with it.</p>

<p>However I have VERY MANY QUESTIONS about running Docker in production. As a
preface &ndash; I have never run containers in production. You should not take
advice from me. So far reading about containers mostly feels like <a href="https://circleci.com/blog/its-the-future/">this hilarious article</a>.</p>

<p>So: your setting is, you have a server, and you want to run programs on that
server. In containers, maybe! Should you use Docker? I have no idea! Let&rsquo;s
talk about what we do know, though.</p>

<p>If you want to know what containers are, you could read <a href="https://medium.com/@gtrevorjay/you-could-have-invented-container-runtimes-an-explanatory-fantasy-764c5b389bd3">You Could Have Invented Container Runtimes: An Explanatory Fantasy</a></p>

<h3 id="reasons-to-use-containers">reasons to use containers</h3>

<p><strong>packaging</strong>. Let&rsquo;s imagine you want to run your application on a computer. Your application depends on some weird JSON library being installed.</p>

<p>Installing stuff on computers so you can run your program on them really
sucks. It&rsquo;s easy to get wrong! It&rsquo;s scary when you make changes! Even if you
use Puppet or Chef or something to install the stuff on the computers, it
sucks.</p>

<p>Containers are nice, because you can install all the stuff your program needs to run in the container <strong>inside the container</strong>.</p>

<p>packaging is a huge deal and it is probably the thing that is most interesting to me about containers right now</p>

<p><strong>scheduling</strong>. $$$. Computers are expensive. If you have custom magical computers that are all set up differently, it&rsquo;s hard to move your programs from running on Computer 1 to running on Computer 2. If you use containers, you can make your computers all the same! Then you can more easily pack your programs onto computers in a more reasonable way. Systems like Kubernetes do this automagically but we are not going to talk about Kubernetes.</p>

<p><strong>better developer environment</strong>. If you can make your application run in a container, then maybe you can also develop it on your laptop in the same container? Maybe? I don&rsquo;t really know much about this.</p>

<p><strong>security</strong>. You can use seccomp-bpf or something to restrict which system calls your program runs? <a href="https://sandstorm.io/">sandstorm</a> does stuff like this. I don&rsquo;t really know.</p>

<p>There are probably more reasons that I&rsquo;ve forgotten right now.</p>

<h3 id="ok-so-what-s-up-with-the-docker-daemon">ok so what&rsquo;s up with the Docker daemon</h3>

<p>Docker has a daemon. Here is an architecture diagram that I shamelessly stole from <a href="https://medium.com/@adriaandejonge/moving-from-docker-to-rkt-310dc9aec938#.mmmi6m9ql">this article</a></p>

<div align="center"><img src="/images/docker-rkt.png"></div>

<p>Usually I run programs on my computers. With Docker, you have to run a magical &ldquo;docker daemon&rdquo; that handles all my containers. Why? I don&rsquo;t know! I don&rsquo;t understand what the Docker daemon is for. With rkt, you just run a process.</p>

<p>People have been telling me stories that sometimes if you do the Wrong
Thing and the Docker daemon has a bug, then the daemon can get deadlocked and
then you have to kill it and all your containers die. I assume they work
pretty hard on fixing these bugs, but I don&rsquo;t <strong>want</strong> to have to trust that
the Docker daemon has no bugs that will affect me. All software has bugs!</p>

<p>If you treat your container more like a process, then you can just run it,
supervise it with supervisord or upstart or whatever your favorite way to
supervise a process is. I know what a process is! I understand processes, kind
of. Also I already use supervisord so I believe in that.</p>

<p>So that kind of makes me want to run rkt, even though it is a Newer Thing.</p>

<h3 id="pid-1">PID 1</h3>

<p>My coworker told me a very surprising thing about containers. If you run just one process in a container, then it apparently gets PID 1? PID 1 is a pretty exciting process. Usually on your computer, <code>init</code> gets PID 1. In particular, if another container process gets orphaned, then it suddenly magically becomes a child of PID 1.</p>

<p>So this is kind of weird, right? You don&rsquo;t want your process to get random zombie processes as children. Like that might be fine, but it violates a lot of normal Unix assumptions about what normally happens to normal processes.</p>

<p>I think &ldquo;violates a lot of normal Unix assumptions about what normally happens to normal processes&rdquo; is basically the whole story about containers.</p>

<p>Yelp made a solution to this called <a href="https://engineeringblog.yelp.com/2016/01/dumb-init-an-init-for-docker.html">dumb-init</a>. It&rsquo;s kind of interesting.</p>

<h3 id="networking">networking</h3>

<p>I wrote a pretty bad blog post about container networking a while back. It can
be really complicated! There are these &ldquo;network namespaces&rdquo; that I don&rsquo;t
really understand, and you need to do port forwarding, and why?</p>

<p>Do you really need to use this complicated container networking stuff? I kind
of just want to run container processes and run them on normal ports in my
normal network namespace and leave it at that. Is that wrong?</p>

<h3 id="secrets">secrets</h3>

<p>Often applications need to have passwords and things! Like to databases! How do you get the passwords into your container? This is a pretty big problem that I&rsquo;m not going to go into now but I wanted to ask the question. (I know there are things like vault by hashicorp. Is using that a good idea? I don&rsquo;t know!)</p>

<h3 id="creating-container-images">creating container images</h3>

<p>To run containers, you need to create container images! There seem to be two main formats: Docker&rsquo;s format and rkt&rsquo;s format. I know nothing about either of them.</p>

<p>One nice thing is that rkt can run Docker containers images. So you could use Docker&rsquo;s tools to make a container but then run it without using Docker.</p>

<p>There are at least 2 ways to make a Docker image: using a Dockerfile and <a href="https://www.packer.io/">packer</a>. Packer lets you provision a container with Puppet or Chef! That&rsquo;s kind of useful.</p>

<h3 id="so-many-questions">so many questions</h3>

<p>From the few (maybe 5?) people I&rsquo;ve talked to about containers so far, the overall consensus seems to be that they&rsquo;re a pretty useful thing, despite all the hype, but that there are a lot of sharp edges and unexpected things that you&rsquo;ll have to make your way through.</p>

<p>Good thing we can all learn on the internet together.</p>
