     <p>I wrote <a href="http://jvns.ca/blog/2015/12/30/do-the-math-on-your-stock-options/">Do the math on your stock options</a> a few days ago, on how I misunderstood how stock options worked when I took my current job. Then I went back to work, with a lot of new questions about how stock options work at my job specifically! This was on Monday.</p>

<p>I had a lot of questions, so I started by asking a few questions in a Slack channel for asking executives questions. I got a super useful answer right away! It turns out that equity is an extremely popular topic so the discussion got split off into a new channel called #equity. IT&rsquo;S AWESOME GUYS. It&rsquo;s been like.. 2 days, and people have asked a ton of questions and had a lot of discussions and learned a lot. A quarter of the company joined the channel immediately.</p>

<p>It turns out that talking about confusing equity / compensation issues in public channels at work is awesome. It means everyone can benefit from the discussion, and everyone realizes that nobody else fully understands what&rsquo;s going on. People with more experience can share what they know, and people with less experience can ask all their questions!</p>

<p>so far it&rsquo;s been like a day and I&rsquo;ve learned</p>

<ul>
<li>that <a href="http://www.foundersworkbench.com/startups-take-note-pinterest-will-allow-ex-employees-to-keep-vested-stock-options-for-seven-years/">Pinterest</a> maybe isn&rsquo;t actually removing the 90-day exercise limit right away, and why it&rsquo;s complicated</li>
<li>that nobody is totally sure how US stock options work in Canada (or internationally, generally)</li>
<li>what the company&rsquo;s liquidation preferences for investors look like</li>
<li>that the company may or may not offer early exercise and uh.. actually I haven&rsquo;t learned this. But now I know that other people also don&rsquo;t know! I&rsquo;ll probably find out soon.</li>
<li>how/whether other companies let their employees sell stock while private (people talked about what they&rsquo;ve heard or seen elsewhere)</li>
<li>that some companies use other equity compensation structures (like <a href="http://personal.fidelity.com/products/stockoptions/aboutsar.shtml">tandem SARs</a>) that are not so expensive for employees.</li>
</ul>

<p>6 people have messaged me to say how much they appreciate the open discussion of the topic. The lawyers / founders / finance people / people who actually know the real answers seem pretty willing to answer questions so far.</p>

<p>I was originally worried that asking questions that amount to &ldquo;what can I do with my stock options if I quit?&rdquo; would somehow be a bad idea or perceived badly. But mostly everyone seems really delighted to talk about it. It&rsquo;s great.</p>
