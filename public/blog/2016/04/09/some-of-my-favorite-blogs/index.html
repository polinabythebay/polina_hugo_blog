     <p><a href="https://rachelbythebay.com/w/">Rachel by the Bay</a> is a blog of sysadmin war stories by&hellip; I&rsquo;m not sure what her full name is! All I know is that she writes these amazing, in-depth, super-technical-and-very-well-written posts like <a href="https://rachelbythebay.com/w/2016/02/21/malloc/">this one about a &ldquo;magic number&rdquo; that was causing memory leaks</a>.</p>

<p>I love <a href="http://danluu.com/">Dan Luu</a>&rsquo;s blog for several reasons, but one of my favorite things is that he frequently writes about hardware. For example, <a href="http://danluu.com/why-ecc/">this post about whether or not you should use error-correcting memory</a> is a topic I would have <strong>no idea</strong> where to start learning about if it were not for his blog. <a href="http://danluu.com/limplock/">When limping hardware is worse than dead hardware</a> is also excellent. He also uses my favorite blog archive tactic which is &ldquo;list all of your posts on your homepage&rdquo;.</p>

<p>While we&rsquo;re talking about systems, we have to talk about <a href="https://aphyr.com/">aphyr&rsquo;s blog, which is mostly about breaking distributed systems</a>. When his blog was originally recommended to me, I honestly struggled with reading it &ndash; the concepts he talks about are difficult to understand if you don&rsquo;t have a lot of experience with distributed systems. But having followed him for a couple of years now, I&rsquo;ve learned a ton and I&rsquo;m extremely happy that he covers distributed systems material in the depth that he does. I also love the introduction to his <a href="https://aphyr.com/posts/301-clojure-from-the-ground-up-welcome">Clojure from the ground up</a> post, and he gives wonderful talks.</p>

<p>In a different direction, I really enjoy reading <a href="http://www.elidedbranches.com/">Camille Fournier</a>&rsquo;s blog. She used to write a lot about distributed systems, now she writes a lot about engineering management, and I love it. I love it because she writes about the ways <a href="http://www.elidedbranches.com/2013/12/2013-constant-introspection-of.html">becoming a manager was hard for her</a>, and she gives advice but you can also see that her thinking is constantly evolving and she&rsquo;s worked hard on getting better. I particularly liked <a href="http://www.elidedbranches.com/2015/10/notes-on-startup-engineering-management.html">Notes on Startup Engineering Management for Young Bloods
</a> and <a href="http://www.elidedbranches.com/2015/11/the-manager-as-debugger.html">The Manager as Debugger</a>. She&rsquo;s now also writing an <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/people/b0050-camille-fournier?intcmp=il-business-na-article-na_20160408_new_site_ask_the_cto_series_link">advice column at O&rsquo;Reilly</a>.</p>

<p>What I love about all of these blogs (and what I strive for in my own writing) is that they all (at least sometimes) write about what they&rsquo;re currently working on or learning about. (&ldquo;look at this weird bug I just discovered! This distributed system I just found a serious bug in! How I changed the way I thought about management this year! This paper I read about data corruption!&rdquo;). They&rsquo;re all by people who are very knowledgeable, and take you along for the ride as they&rsquo;re learning and experimenting.</p>

<p>My constant wish with blogging is for more people to write blogs where they tell me what they&rsquo;re working on and what they&rsquo;re thinking about. Maybe you will do it!</p>

<p>(there are so many many more than 4 blogs that I like. I have left out <a href="http://composition.al/blog/2015/03/31/what-isnt-a-key-value-store/">Lindsey Kuper</a>, <a href="https://www.harihareswara.net/sumana/2016/03/29/0">Sumana Harihareswara</a>, <a href="http://blog.plover.com/aliens/dd/intro.html">Mark Dominus</a>, <a href="http://blog.jessitron.com/2015/06/ultratestable-coding-style.html">Jessica Kerr</a>, <a href="http://akaptur.com/blog/2014/08/03/getting-started-with-python-internals/">Allison Kaptur</a>, <a href="http://accidentallyquadratic.tumblr.com/post/142387131042/nodejs-left-pad">Nelson Elhage</a>, <a href="http://embedded.fm/blog/takingaparttoys">embedded.fm</a>, <a href="https://mathbabe.org/2016/03/30/apple-vs-fbi-nobody-won/">Cathy O&rsquo;Neil</a>, <a href="http://gigasquidsoftware.com/blog/2012/09/20/7-john-mccarthy-papers-in-7-weeks-1/">Carin Meier</a>, and a lot more). In all these cases I&rsquo;ve linked to a specific blog post of theirs that I enjoy instead of just their homepage.</p>
