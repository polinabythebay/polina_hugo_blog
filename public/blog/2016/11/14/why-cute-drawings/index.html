     <p>Every day in November, I&rsquo;ve been making small drawings about Linux. You
can find them all at <a href="https://drawings.jvns.ca">https://drawings.jvns.ca</a>.</p>

<p>Someone commented today on a tech news site:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I don’t understand why these, frankly, childish drawings of things you
can learn from reading a wikipedia article have reached this level of
popularity.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>this comment was a bit inflammatory, but I think it&rsquo;s actually an
interesting question: why <em>are</em> these pretty simple drawings so popular?</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a reply:</p>

<p>I’d be the first to point out that I’m <a href="https://twitter.com/b0rk/status/797644696243859456/photo/1">not a particularly talented artist</a>. So why do I spend my time drawing comics, when I’m not even that
good at drawing?</p>

<p>it’s because I’ve found they’re, in some situations, such a great way to
communicate that I feel silly not taking advantage of it
A few reasons:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Comics are great for summarizing. I wrote a <a href="https://stripe.com/blog/service-discovery-at-stripe">blog post at work</a>
about
how we do service discovery. I started out with just writing 1200
words, and trying to be as informative as possible. I thought it was
pretty good. But then I drew a comic summarizing a main ideas! A
really common reaction was “wow, the blog post took me 15 minutes to
understand, but after reading the comic I understood the main ideas in
30 seconds”. This is awesome because somebody can see the main ideas
and decide whether they want to continue reading.</p></li>

<li><p>I can trick people into reading about useful concepts that they might
otherwise think are too hard or not useful or not fun. I wrote a zine
called &ldquo;linux debugging tools you’ll love&rdquo; (<a href="https://jvns.ca/zines">here</a>). This zine discusses
a lot of tools which are traditionally considered a little bit
advanced. Because of that, a lot of people don’t even know those tools exist,
or might not consider trying them! All kinds of people have told me
“julia, i read your zine, and the next day I used a tool in it to fix
a bug at work”.</p></li>

<li><p>They’re an awesome way to introduce people to new ideas. Anyone can
learn about /proc! It is not that complicated. But a lot of people
don’t even know /proc is interesting. <a href="https://twitter.com/b0rk/status/796554983810498560">This drawing about /proc</a>
took me
maybe 15 minutes to draw. I posted it on twitter and it got 180,000
impressions. A lot of people replied to me “wow, that’s so useful, I
didn’t even know that that existed, I’m going to go learn more about
that now!!”. They will probably learn more about it by reading the man
page or Wikipedia or some more traditional means. But they learned
about it from a small drawing :)</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I started drawing things because my wrists hurt a lot and I was too
stressed out about it to use my computer after work.</p>

<p>But these days I draw things because I love telling people things about computers
that help them (&ldquo;omg julia, i had no idea about this, this, this is so
useful&rdquo;), and simple drawings turn out to be a pretty effective way to do
that. I don&rsquo;t do it because I&rsquo;m a visual thinker or because I&rsquo;m a good
artist or because I think comics are always the best way to learn. I
just do it because it works, and it&rsquo;s fun.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s keep experimenting with different ways to talk about
technology to each other! Lin Clark has a site
<a href="https://code-cartoons.com/">Code Cartoons</a> mostly about web development and it is great.</p>
