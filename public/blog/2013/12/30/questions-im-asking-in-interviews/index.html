<p>In a fit of &ldquo;open source your interview process&rdquo;, I tweeted yesterday
with the list of questions I&rsquo;m drawing from when interviewing. A lot
of people
<a href="https://gist.github.com/jvns/8178076">responded in the gist</a> with
amazing suggestions, and I thought I&rsquo;d consolidate them here so they
don&rsquo;t get lost in my pile of gists.</p>

<p>My basic strategy is to spend 20 minutes before each interview I do
and pick some appropriate questions from this list. I&rsquo;ve tried to
categorize them a bit. A lot of these are outright stolen from
<a href="https://medium.com/what-i-learned-building/f7a161b5bc70">Edward O&rsquo;Campo-Gooding&rsquo;s list of questions</a>,
as well as from various people at
<a href="http://hackerschool.com">Hacker School</a>. I&rsquo;d love suggestions for
more!</p>

<p>Special thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/bmastenbrook">@bmastenbrook</a>,
<a href="https://twitter.com/bmastenbrook">@marcprecipice</a>,
<a href="https://twitter.com/danluu">@danluu</a>,

<a href="https://twitter.com/zmagg">@zmagg</a>,
<a href="https://twitter.com/graue">@graue</a>, and
<a href="https://twitter.com/ircolle">@ircolle</a> for awesome question
suggestions.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> A few more things:</p>

<ul>
<li>I don&rsquo;t ask all of these in first interviews. Use your discretion,
and do what you feel comfortable doing.</li>
<li>Asking a lot of questions shows that you value yourself and that
you&rsquo;re careful when making decisions. It&rsquo;s a good thing.</li>
<li>If you have an offer, you can schedule extra conversations if you
feel that not all of your questions have been answered.</li>
<li>It can be worth asking the same question to more than one person.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="engineering-practices">Engineering practices</h3>

<ul>
<li>What version control system do you use? (if none, the interview
should be over =))</li>
<li>Do you test your code?</li>
<li>How do you make sure that all code is understood by more than one
person?</li>
<li>Do you do code review? Does all code get reviewed?</li>
<li>Do you have an issue tracker?</li>
<li>Describe your deployment process &ndash; how do you find bugs in your
team&rsquo;s code? What recourse do you have when you find a serious bug
in production code?</li>
<li>Who is responsible for doing deployment? How often do you deploy?</li>
<li>How do you think about code correctness?</li>
<li>When something goes wrong, how do you handle it? Do devs get shamed
for breaking the build?</li>
<li>How/when do developers talk to non-developers? Is it easy to talk to
the people who are will be using your product?</li>
<li>Can I see some code the team I&rsquo;m interviewing for has written? (from
an open-source project you work on, for example)</li>
<li>Who are the people at your company with a lot of depth of
experience? Will I be able to talk to them?</li>
<li>What&rsquo;s your approach to technical debt?</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="management-style">Management style</h3>

<ul>
<li>How does engineering work get assigned?</li>
<li>How are technical decisions made and communicated?</li>
<li>How do you balance support work and feature development?</li>
<li>Can you give me an example of someone who&rsquo;s been in a technical role
at your company for a long time, and how their responsibilities and
role have changed? (I <em>love</em> this question)</li>
<li>Do you have a dedicated designer? QA? Technical writer? Dev manager?</li>
<li>How often do you have meetings? Are there any scheduled/standing
meetings? Who talks to customers (if appropriate) and how?</li>
<li>Has there been a situation where someone raised an ethical concern?
If so, how was it handled? If not, have there really not been any?</li>
<li>How are decisions made? Is architecture dictated top down? Are ideas
from anyone welcomed? If so, in what scope/context?</li>
<li>How are disagreements solved - both technical disagreements and
other kinds? What happens when personalities clash?</li>
<li>Can you tell me about a time when you&rsquo;ve had to let someone go?</li>
<li>Is there a written roadmap all developers can see? How far into the
future does it extend? How closely is it followed?</li>
<li>How is performance evaluated?</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="quality-of-life">Quality of life</h3>

<ul>
<li>How much vacation do people get? If there&rsquo;s &ldquo;unlimited&rdquo; vacation,
how much vacation do people normally take?</li>
<li>Is it possible to take sabbaticals or unpaid vacation?</li>
<li>How many women work for you? What&rsquo;s your process for making sure you
have diversity in other ways?</li>
<li>How many hours do people work in an average week? In your busiest
weeks?</li>
<li>Is variability tolerated or is everyone expected to be on the same
schedule?</li>
<li>What time do people normally leave work?</li>
<li>Would I need to be on call? How often?</li>
<li>How often are there emergencies or times when people have to work
extra hours?</li>
<li>What is your turnover rate like? How many devs were hired last year
and how many left?</li>
<li>What&rsquo;s your retention rate of women over 1.5 years? Do you think you
could have done anything differently to keep people who left?</li>
<li>Do people work on the weekend?</li>
<li>Do people check in when they&rsquo;re on vacation? How often?</li>
<li>Is it possible to work from home, say, 1 or 2 days a week? Does
anyone do this? (can be a nice option to have)</li>
<li>Does this position require travel? How often?</li>
</ul>

<p>As many of these as possible are &ldquo;statistical&rdquo; questions &ndash; a company may say that they &ldquo;don&rsquo;t have hours&rdquo;, but if everyone leaves at 9pm that&rsquo;s not a good sign.</p>

<h3 id="community-involvement">Community involvement</h3>

<ul>
<li>Do you contribute to open source projects? Which projects? Which teams work on open source?
Do you work mostly in the community or do you have a private fork?</li>
<li>Do your employees speak at conferences about your work?</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="career-development">Career development</h3>

<ul>
<li>Are employees encouraged to go speak at conferences?</li>
<li>Do you cover travel to conferences? How many conferences a year do
devs typically go to?</li>
<li>Does your company support continuing education? (will they pay for
employees to do a master&rsquo;s degree?)</li>
<li>In what other ways do you support career development?</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="culture">Culture</h3>

<ul>
<li>How do you determine if someone is a poor fit for your company?</li>
<li>How are your teams structured? What is the management structure
like?</li>
<li>How often do you pair? What&rsquo;s pairing like? How often do
inexperienced people work directly with experienced people?</li>
<li>What&rsquo;s the onboarding process like?</li>
<li>Is there any sort of institutionalized way of dealing with
plateauing or preventing burnout? (Expecting to hear about rotation
of duties or location, sabbaticals.)</li>
<li>Is it easy to move to other divisions or offices?</li>
<li>How does internal communication work? This one is super important
and I need to remember to ask it more.</li>
<li>Are there catered suppers? (possibly bad)</li>
<li>How many hours a week does senior management work? Do they put in
80-hour weeks?</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="financials-business-model-growth">Financials/business model/growth</h3>

<ul>
<li>Are you profitable?

<ul>
<li>if not, how does this affect what you can do? What&rsquo;s your
planned timeline for becoming profitable?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>How do you make money? (I often explain to my parents or
non-technical friends companies&rsquo; business models to test if they
really make sense.)</li>
<li>How much are you planning to hire in the next year?</li>
<li>Are company financials, minus salaries, transparent throughout the
company?</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="things-to-look-for-in-real-life">Things to look for in real life</h3>

<ul>
<li>How is the office space physically organized?</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="other">Other</h3>

<ul>
<li>Can you tell me about how the interview process is structured? How
many interviews are there?</li>
<li>How often do you offer above asking? Can I speak with someone who
got such an offer?</li>
<li>What do you wish you had known when you joined this company?</li>
<li>Why did you choose to join this company?</li>
<li>What&rsquo;s the single biggest issue or problem facing the
team/department/company?&rdquo; What&rsquo;s currently being done to address it?</li>
</ul>
