<p>The other day I was having a discussion with someone about whether or
not &ldquo;guys&rdquo; was a gender-neutral term. This person said &ldquo;my friends
totally think it is!&ldquo;, and I verified with my friends, who totally
said it wasn&rsquo;t. Not the best grounds for a discussion.</p>

<p>So I ran a slightly-more-scientific survey. Here are
<a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1qg85hU7hfjqDgydlfa16UveuENFjgp23WlfkRNsnm48/viewform">the survey questions</a>,
which you can still answer if you like. This resulted in
<a href="http://storify.com/jvns/guys-guys-guys">a bunch of discussion on Twitter</a>,
which was at least as interesting as the survey results. Lots of
people wanted to know the results, so here they are! About 2300 people
replied.</p>

<p>You can download the entire result set from the
<a href="https://github.com/jvns/guys-guys-guys">GitHub repository</a>.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a summary of the survey results. I&rsquo;ve split it up by gender: I
asked each person &ldquo;Do you identify as a woman?&rdquo;, so I&rsquo;ve split the
categories into &ldquo;Women&rdquo;, and &ldquo;Men + Other&rdquo;.</p>

<p>The main thing I find interesting here is how women and men perceive
these words differently: about 50% of men (+ other) think that &ldquo;Java
guys&rdquo; is gender neutral, while only 25% of women do. There&rsquo;s a similar
split for &ldquo;Python guy&rdquo; and &ldquo;Erlang guy&rdquo;.</p>

<p>The image probably appears too small here: click for the bigger image.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the gender distribution:</p>

<h3 id="issues-with-the-survey">Issues with the survey</h3>

<p>This really isn&rsquo;t meant to be a scientific study or anything &ndash; think
of it as informally polling a few of your friends, except if you had a
lot of friends. But here are some of the science issues:</p>

<ul>
<li>The gender split question could be better. Specifically, I&rsquo;d use:
&ldquo;How do you identify? m/f/other&rdquo;.</li>
<li>There&rsquo;s tons of selection bias, because the survey was only
distributed through Twitter retweets.</li>
<li>The framing of the survey is pretty biased &ndash; I said things like
&ldquo;someone is trying to convince me that &lsquo;guys&rsquo; is a gender neutral
term&rdquo; in my tweets about the survey.</li>
<li>People could optionally fill in where they were from, but I ignored
that information.</li>
<li>There are a lot of shades of grey: ideally people would rate each
sentence on a 5-point scale or something.</li>
</ul>

<p>I think presenting this as a survey was a great way to get people to
engage in a discussion in a mostly non-heated way and think about the
way they use language.</p>

<p>Several people told me that they thought that &ldquo;guys&rdquo; was a totally
gender-neutral term and were surprised by their results when they took
the survey. Awesome! A++ would survey again.</p>
