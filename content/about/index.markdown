### About me

Hi there! My name is Polina, and I'm a software engineer at <a href="https://www.indiegogo.com" target="_blank">Indiegogo</a>. I'm very passionate about building for the web-- software engineering is a means through which I can be proud of building services that empower those around me.

I graduated from Wellesley College with a degree in <a href="http://www.wellesley.edu/cs" target="_blank">Computer Science</a> and currently reside in San Francisco. When I'm not coding, you can find me listening to podcasts, running, and learning about the world and people through stories.
